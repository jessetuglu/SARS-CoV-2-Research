0,"COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.

There is a close genetic relatedness between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2"
1,"Whereas positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract has been described 9 , these observations do not address principal differences between SARS and COVID-19 in terms of clinical pathology"
2,"In cases when this initial diagnostic testing was done by other laboratories, the original samples were retrieved and re-tested under the rigorous quality standards of the present study.

To first understand whether the described clinical presentations are solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, samples from all patients were tested against a panel of typical agents of respiratory viral infection, including HCoV-HKU1, -OC43, -NL63, -229E; Influenza virus A and B, Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Human Parainfluenza virus 1-4, Human metapneumovirus, Adenovirus, and Human bocavirus"
3,"Together, these data indicate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the throat during the first 5 days after symptoms onset"
4,"The two patients who showed some signs of pneumonia were the only cases where sputum viral loads showed a late and high peak around day 10/11, whereas sputum viral loads were on the decline by this time in all other patients (Figure 2 F,G) .

Seroconversion was detected by IgG and IgM immunofluorescence using cells expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a virus neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 ( Table   3 )"
5,"At the same time, the concurrent use of ACE-2 as a receptor by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to a highly similar excretion kinetic in sputum, with active replication in the lung"
6,"Whereas proof of replication by histopathology is awaited, extended tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 with replication in the throat is strongly supported by our studies of sgRNAtranscribing cells in throat swab samples, particularly during the first 5 days of symptoms.

Striking additional evidence for independent replication in the throat is provided by sequence findings in one patient who consistently showed a distinct virus in her throat as opposed to the lung"
7,"Critically, the majority of patients in the present study seemed to be already beyond One of the most interesting hypotheses to explain a potential extension of tropism to the throat is the presence of a polybasic furin-type cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is not present in SARS-CoV 17 "
8,"Replication in the gastrointestinal tract is also supported by analogy with SARS-CoV, which was regularly excreted in stool, from which it could be isolated in cell culture 23 .

Our failure to isolate live SARS-CoV-2 from stool may be due to the mild courses of cases, with only one case showing intermittent diarrhea"
9,Further studies should therefore address whether SARS-CoV-2 shed in stool is rendered non-infectious though contact with the gut environment
10,"This assay used cloned CoV spike protein from HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and SARS-CoV-2"
11,"A/H1N1pdm09 has subsequently transitioned into a seasonal pattern causing winter epidemics in temperate climates.

Here we use data on seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs in Sweden and model the impact of this variation on the possible future spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere"
12,"We also explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread in temperate and tropical regions and show how variation in epidemiological parameters affects a potential pandemic and the possibility of transitioning to an endemic state.

Data on seasonal variation of HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E diagnoses in respiratory samples was obtained from the routine molecular diagnostics at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"
13,"The strength of variation of the transmission rate through the year could be of high relevance to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and following years.

We consider simple SIR models (Kermack and McKendrick, 1991) with an additional category E of exposed individuals of the form

where β(t) is the rate at which an infected individual infects a susceptible one, µ is the inverse incubation time, ν is the recovery rate and b is the population turn-over rate.

Depending on the analysis below, we implement several such populations that exchange individuals through migration, for details see Supplementary Methods"
14,"The qualitative behavior of the fit is robust to uncertainty in R 0 and the frequency of reinfection b.

The analysis of seasonal CoV prevalence patterns allowed us to constrain parameter ranges and explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the globe, in particular in temperate climates like Northern Europe.

Here we explore scenarios where temperate regions have a seasonal forcing of between ε = 0.3 and 0.7 and migration rates of 0.01/year"
15,3 shows simulated trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the temperate Northern Hemisphere assuming the outbreak started in Hubei early December 2019
16,"Depending whether the peak transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in the northern temperate zone is in November, January, or March, the simulation predicts a main peak in the first half of 2020, a main peak in winter 2020/2021, or two similarly sized peaks.

To explore possible scenarios more systematically, we ran such simulations for a range of values for R 0 and peak transmissibility θ and recorded whether we observe and early peak, a late peak, or a two peaks"
17,"We have witnessed such rapid dispersal to SARS-CoV-2 to many countries across the globe during January and February 2020.

Every location has a different socio-economic profile such that the growth rate of the epidemic (and hence R 0 ) might differ"
18,"7 .

After several years, SARS-CoV-2 could become a seasonal CoV with characteristic winter outbreaks as shown in Fig"
19,"4 is run for 12 years, with the added assumption that after infection an individual become susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 again at a rate of 0.1 per year as we assumed for seasonal CoV above"
20,"After a pronounced low in 2020-2024, prevalence recovers and settles into a seasonal pattern, similar to that of the four existing seasonal CoVs.

We report on the possible influence of seasonal variation on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Northern Hemisphere, in a pandemic scenario"
21,We find that seasonal variation in transmissibility has the potential to modulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a wide range of possible outcomes that need to be taken into account when interpreting case counts and projecting the outbreak dynamics
22,"The onset of spring and summer could, for example, give the impression that SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully contained, only for infections to increase again in 2020-2021 winter season"
23,"/2020 If previously infected individuals can be reinfected after some time, as for example by seasonal influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 could develop into a seasonal CoV that returns every winter"
24,"The results we present are critically dependent on the assumptions i) that the outbreak will develop into a pandemic, ii) that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonal variability of sufficient strength (range ε = 0.3 to 0.7), and iii) that parameters like R 0 estimated from the early phase of the outbreak are comparable in other populations"
25,"These assumptions are not implausible but not certain: cases of SARS-CoV-2 has been in several countries in Asia apart from China, as well as in Europe, Africa, North America, and Australia (WHO Emergency Committee, 2020b), and mild or asymptomatic cases make detection and thus prevention of spread by isolation challenging, e.g"
26,"It should be noted, however, that SARS-CoV-2 does seem to transmit in tropical climates like Singapore, and so winter is not a necessary condition of SARS-CoV-2 spread"
27,(2020) showing that recent trends in different regions across East-Asia imply that seasonality alone is unlikely to end SARS-CoV-2 spread
28,"The implications of our work are that: 1) reductions in prevalence need not be attributable to successful interventions, but could be due to seasonal variation in transmissibility, 2) sub-population dynamics can differ greatly, meaning that case count trajectories in one country should be used cautiously to inform projections in a second country, even in the same climate zone, 3) seasonal variation might slow down a pandemic and thereby provide a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems world-wide by scaling up capacity for care and diagnostics, and potentially through rapid development of antivirals and vaccine, and 4) after several years SARS-CoV-2 could develop into an endemic seasonal CoV similar to the transition of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic influenza virus into a seasonal influenza virus.

The overall impact of a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic depends critically on the case fatality ratio (CFR), which we have not modelled here"
29,"Even with this unknown, seasonal variation in transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and underlying differences in migration, introduction times, and attack rate should thus be taken into account when monitoring and projecting global transmission, planning further surveillance of the epidemic, and developing pandemic prevention and containment strategies.

All relevant data and script that generate the graphs are available in a dedicated github repository at github"
30,"On February 11, 2020, WHO Director-General announced that the novel coronavirus was officially named ""SARS-CoV-2"" On February 7, 2020, the Chinese Health and Health Commission temporarily named novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia as novel coronavirus pneumonia, abbreviated as""NCP"" [4] "
31,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date"
32,"The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country.

As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China"
33,"Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.

The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan City, China at the end of 2019, has caused large numbers of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 and deaths in Wuhan"
34,"There are also particular issues in an outbreak of a novel pathogen due to difficulties in mobilizing the response and in development of testing capacities, as well as changes over time in the definition of SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms"
35,Since then others have used flight and other data to highlight countries at most risk of importation of SARS-CoV-2 from China
36,"12 In light of this, there is some urgency to assessing the relative risks of onward transmission between countries outside of China.

Therefore in this paper we estimate 1) the number of imported cases globally from Wuhan (using flight data and the currently reported cases), then using our estimates of the number of imported cases and current estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2 we estimate, 2) the probability of an outbreak in countries outside mainland China, and finally given this outbreak risk and the flights between countries outside mainland China, we estimate 3) the risk index for importations occurring from and to countries outside mainland China"
37,"We included these into our data as having originated from Wuhan to avoid producing false positive results when we later on identified countries that may have under-detected SARS-CoV-2 importation from Wuhan.

We used the monthly number of air ticket bookings during 2017 from the Official Airline Guide 14 to approximate the volumes of air passengers for each origin-destination route.

For each country or territory outside of mainland China (denoted by ), we assumed that the total number of COVID-19 cases imported from Wuhan ( ) followed a Poisson distribution with rate parameter proportional to the number of air travelers from Wuhan during January 2020 ( → , ), with an unknown coefficient 0 to be estimated from data (more detail in supporting information):

To date, the reported total number of imported cases from Wuhan ( ) differ substantially between countries even after adjusting for the volumes of air passengers arriving from Wuhan"
38,"Countries with a local outbreak risk above 0.5 in our main analysis were named as potential donor countries, and subsequently assessed for their relative potential of exporting SARS-CoV-2 to any recipient country or territory outside mainland China, described as follows.

For each recipient country outside mainland China , we derived a COVID-19 introduction index → (on a relative scale) that ranks potential donor countries in terms of their viral exportation potential"
39,"In some of these places, testing may be already increasing, but if not, our results would suggest that these places should be targets for increased screening and testing for SARS-CoV-2.

We next probabilistically determine the risk of local transmission within countries outside mainland China"
40,Background Whether the patients with COVID-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute renal function damage is a problem worthy of clinical attention
41,"This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.

Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020"
42,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR.

Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease"
43,"In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19"
44,"Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF.

In December 2019, an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is now officially named as ""2019 coronavirus disease "" by the WHO [1] [2] [3] "
45,"Whole genome sequencing and systematic analysis showed that this novel coronavirus is a distinct clade from beta coronavirus associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [6] , which was officially named ""SARS-CoV-2"" by WHO now"
46,"Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated, current evidence suggests it was transmitted to humans through the spread of wild animals illegally sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [7] "
47,Case reports have confirmed the interpersonal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [8] 
48,"reported in 138 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed cases, presumed hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3% [10] "
49,"In this study, the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed, and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function were explored.

Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is located in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, an area where COVID-19 is endemic"
50,"This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.

All COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were laboratory-confirmed cases, which were identified with nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a throat swab samples using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)"
51,The criteria for the confirmed-diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was that at least one gene site was amplified to be positive for nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1ab gene
52,19.20025288 doi: medRxiv preprint was used for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
53,"Specific primers and probes for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn /kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html).

Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics were recorded"
54,"Data from above two studies suggested that acute renal impairment was uncommon in COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious azotemia and acute renal injury.

Based on the clinical, pathologic study, and laboratory features of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients in 2003, the data showed that acute renal impairment was uncommon, but carried a formidably high mortality (91.7%, 33 of 36 cases) [17] "
55,Be cause high homology of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
56,"In this study, we also observed that the patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and confirmed as COVID-19"
57,"Unlike a formidably high mortality in SARS complicated with renal impairment, none of the patients died from the aggravation of CRF or from COVID-19 itself caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2"
58,"Kaplan-Meier curve was constructed by the survival and survminer package in R, version 3.6.0 (http://www.r-project.org/).

291 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study.

Epidemiological and baseline characteristics of patients in detail were shown in Table 1 "
59,"While most symptoms were more frequently seen in severe/critical group, nausea or vomiting were more common in mild group, which may indicate different body responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with different health state and immune system defensive characteristics"
60,"19 We speculate in the lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 or the secondary systemic inflammation, the activated body stress system may lead to the increase of fibrinogen"
61,"The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 epidemic as an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020.

To prevent further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, 31 Provinces in China Mainland had raised their public health response level to the highest state of emergency (level-1) by January 29, 2020"
62,"Wuhan still has much to do.

SARS-CoV-2 has diversity transmission approaches, including respiratory (mouth foam) and contact routes which have been confirmed, as well as aerosol and digestive (fecal-oral) routes which cannot be ruled out (National Health Commission of China, 2020)"
63,"SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, Wang et al (2020) projected that without any control measure the infected population would exceed 200,000 in Wuhan by the end of February"
64,"The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, and the simplest and most direct thing that can explain this is the data (Fig.7) .

The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is still rapidly growing and spread to more than 42 countries as of February 27, 2020.

At present, the most serious countries outside China are South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan"
65,"SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to other parts of Hubei province, other parts of China, and 29 countries, resulting in 17680 cases and 508 deaths (estimated fatality: 2.87%), 12975 cases and 100 deaths (0.77%), and 2105 cases and 24 deaths (1.14%), respectively (up to February 24, 2020)"
66,"The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is higher and the fatality is lower compared to SARS-CoV, although the two CoVs share the receptor-human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)"
67,"Furthermore, the disease course of COVID-19, the duration of viral existence, and the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers remain unknown"
68,"Extremely severe type met one of the following criteria: respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation, shock, and combined organ failure that need to be treated in intensive care unit.

Patients were discharged from hospital if they met the criteria: temperature normalized for at least 3 days, apparent improvement in respiratory symptoms, absorption of lung inflammation, and negative SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA tested for twice at 1 day interval"
69,"The mean incubation was 9.06 (95% CI, 6.11-12.00) days for patients without pneumonia and 7.54 (95% CI, 5.29-9.79) days for patients with pneumonia.

Of the 55 patients, 32 had regular SARS-CoV-2 examination data"
70,"Of the 32 patients, one co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and three cases whose samples were intermittently positive were excluded.

The mean (95% CI) SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from the first SARS-CoV-2-positive test to RT-PCR conversion in the remaining 28 cases was 9.71 (8.21-11.22) days"
71,"Patient A, who was long-term bed-ridden, was infected with SARS-CoV-2.

She contacted only 4 healthy family members within 2 weeks before illness onset.

The members did not have direct or indirect exposure history"

73,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.20028068 doi: medRxiv preprint history, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 transmits predominantly via respiratory droplet.

As SARS-CoV-2 shares its receptor with SARS-CoV, 6 We revealed that the mean incubation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 8.42 days"
74,"Thus, the incubation from this study should be important in quarantining close contactors outside the outbreak zone.

The durations of COVID-19 course and SARS-CoV-2-positive course are not reported previously"
75,21 The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration 
76,"SARS-CoV-2 might be present in patients for around 18 days by adding the mean incubation of 8.42 days.

This duration seems to be shorter than SARS"
77,"27 Thus, IL-6 might bridge SARS-CoV-2 infection and alveolar cell injury via inducing "
78,"Second, the family members of patient B's sister were not examined for SARS-CoV-2, because they left when we performed this study.

Third, half patients are still hospitalized"
79,"28 Finally, we characterized the epidemiological features including the incubation period, time to RT-PCR conversion of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 course, and the transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers"
80,"We expect this critical review will provide insights to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a more systematic manner.

Systematic searches were performed via the Medline database (PubMed) and Embase combining the terms (novel coronavirus OR 2019 novel coronavirus OR 2019-nCoV OR Coronavirus disease 2019 OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2)"

85,"The RNA genome of 2019-nCoV features an identity of about 82% to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV); both viruses belong to clade b of the genus Betacoronavirus.

Hence, it has been proposed to rename the new virus as SARS-CoV-2 (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) .

One of the best characterized drug targets among coronaviruses is the main protease (M pro , also called 3CL pro )"
86,"At present, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a newly recognized viruse, has spread rapidly throughout Wuhan (Hubei province) to other provinces in China and around the world, and has infected closed to 80,000 people in China and killed more than 2,000 untill Feb 26, 2020 because of no specific and effective drug.

The link between many of the December cases and the Huanan Seafood Market indicates that the Huanan Seafood Market is one of the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2, if not only.

After the forced shutdown of the Huanan Seafood Market on January 1 st , the effectiveness of the zoonotic infection and a potential secondary source of SARS-CoV-2 that continued to infect the Wuhan people remained in question.

118,It is reported that combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir had been applied to SARS-CoV-2 patients with substantial clinical benefit
119,"Despite the virus caused 55 SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, 56 their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different"

121,"Similar to outbreaks of other respiratory pathogens (1) (2) (3) (4) , syndromic airport screening at arrival of travellers from regions with a high risk of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to prevent a sufficient proportion of infected travellers to prevent global spread (5, 6) "
122,"Sensitising arriving travellers to the symptoms and risk of SARS-CoV-2 and to encourage selfisolation as well as rapidly seeking for medical assistance via telephone which in turn will trigger tracing and quarantine of contacts, may have a more pronounced effect and is currently implemented in many transport hubs"
123,"We aim to estimate the effectiveness of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation for delaying the onset of sustained SARS-CoV-2 spread in previously unaffected regions.

We represent the potential importation of infections by an average number of infected travellers per week, λ , attempting to travel to a specific country or region currently not experiencing an outbreak"
124,"For those assumptions, Quilty et al estimate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers not being detected at either exit or entry screening as 46% and as 42% for exit-only screening (6) .

We represent traveller sensitisation as reducing "
125,"Sensitisation occurs via, e.g., posters and handouts to travellers arriving from high risk regions, which increases the likelihood that those travellers, if they experience SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, will self-isolate on the occurrence of mild symptoms and rapidly report to health care providers who in turn trigger contact tracing"
126,"As a base case, in line with Hellewell et al (7) we assume that these measures to accelerate self-isolation and reporting in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can reduce the average number of onward transmitting secondary infections by about 50%.

To determine the impact of interventions, we calculate the difference in time to outbreak occurrence with and without interventions: 

We considered three syndromic screening intervention scenarios: no screening, exit-only, and exit-and-entry screening"
127,"Comparisons are made to no contact tracing and no screening (there are no ""No screening"" results at 0% sensitisation as this is the baseline against which comparisons are to be made).

Syndromic screening of air travellers at departure and/or arrival is unlikely to prevent a sufficient proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers from entering a yet unaffected country and thereby prevent a local outbreak"
128,"We investigate here how syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation, as well as their combination, may delay an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2"
129,"These results are sensitive to a number of key assumptions: with increasing R 0 , less heterogeneous R 0 or less effect of traveller sensitisation the estimated achievable delay quickly becomes negligible We find a potential role for interventions targeting air-passengers to delay major outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in previously unaffected regions as long as implemented when there are only a few infected travellers per week"
130,"Of note, however, is that syndromic screening at arrival only substantially adds to control efforts if syndromic screening at departure is absent or largely ineffective.

While our findings may encourage implementation of both syndromic screening on entry and traveller sensitisation in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is important to note that these findings are highly sensitive to the underlying base-case assumptions and do not consider the economic implications of large scale air passenger screening and contact tracing"
131,"While all of our assumptions include the best knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 to date, there is considerable uncertainty associated with all of these assumptions"
132,"Over the last few weeks, only a few SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers have been reported with symptoms within a few days after their arrival (15)"
133,"It does also run the risk that travellers arriving in the US despite their travel history would likely not be reached by targeted sensitisation and/or that they would avoid self-reporting if symptomatic, with potentially dire implications for local spread.

In summary, we find that targeting air-travellers with syndromic screening at exit or entry and sensitisation for signs of symptoms following their arrival may delay a major outbreak in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak"

162,"As expected, the polyclonal antibodies showed weaker binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (EC 50 >100ng/mL) as compared to SARS-CoV S1 protein (EC 50 <25ng/mL)"
163,"Neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV were lower by more than two-orders of magnitudes than SARS-CoV PSV (Table 1) , presenting a pessimistic forecast for the probability to identify highly potent and cross-reactive nAbs to SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV antibodies or antibody libraries.

SARS-CoV monoclonal nAbs with strong S1 binding (EC 50 <50ng/mL, K D ≤2.0E-10 M) and potent ACE2-blocking activities exhibited potent neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV (minimum dose to reach 100% neutralization at ~0.1μg/mL), but almost no cross-binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (EC 50 >15μg/mL) and no cross-neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV (<50% neutralizing activity at 100μg/mL) (Figure3, Table 2, Figure S1 & S2).

Interestingly, three ACE2-non-blocking monoclonal antibodies showed modest binding activities to SARS-CoV S1 protein (EC 50 >100ng/mL) and neutralizing activities to the SARS-CoV PSV (minimum dose to reach 100% neutralization at ≥ 10 μg/mL)"

Taking the two viruses' RBD structure similarities and glycosylation sites into account, we predict that there are two possible conserved regions in RBD where epitopes for cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies reside"
170,"Note that N 357 ST in SARS-CoV is changed to N 370 SA in SARS-CoV-2, which is different from the NXS/T pattern required for glycosylation, and hence this site is more likely to be unglycosylated"
171,"Hence, understanding the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and their implications may offer significant scientific and practical value.

Though it is difficult to assess the virus-host-cell interactions with real virion, we studied the new SARS-CoV-2 in head-to-head comparisons with SARS-CoV using multiple methods"
172,"Measurements of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins to recombinant ACE2 protein and ACE2 expressing 293T cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to human ACE2 (Figure 2A&B) , which provided direct molecular based evidences to support and possibly explain the observation that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has similar transmissibility to SARS-CoV virus.

Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are both coronaviruses with over 70% sequence homology and share the same human receptor ACE2, analyzing SARS-CoV's antibodies' cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 may provide useful information on whether neutralizing epitopes were conserved on the two coronaviruses"
173,Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies produced with SARS-CoV S1 and RBD proteins had potent binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV but only modest cross-binding and cross-neutralizing activities to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus
174,"However, virtually no cross-binding or cross neutralizing activities against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus were detected with the four ACE2 blocking monoclonal antibodies.

We then screened non-ACE2-blocking antibodies raised from SARS-CoV RBD for neutralizing activities"

The observation that these three antibodies bind to and neutralize both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 without blocking ACE2 suggest the following"

Before January 20, 2020, when human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 was officially confirmed, people had not realized the infection of the epidemic and the SARS-CoV-2 was in a state of natural transmission"
228,"From analysis, we draw the following conclusions: (1) We used the experimental results before January 20, 2020 (before the official confirmation that COVID-19 has the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission) to simulate the natural transmission of the SARS-CoV-2"
229,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) is an emerging respiratory infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV), which first occurred in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China"
230,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593 doi: medRxiv preprint symptoms), and date of confirmed diagnosis (the laboratory confirmation date of SARS-CoV-2 in the bio-samples)"
231,20 A laboratory-confirmed case was defined if the patient had a positive test of SARS-CoV-2 virus by the real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay or high-throughput sequencing of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens
232,"However, due to the novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and a relative lack of surveillance data on the existing human coronaviruses, it has not been possible to project how the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in the coming years, including the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the seasonal coronaviruses.

We used data from the United States to model betacoronavirus transmission in temperate regions and to project the possible dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the year 2025"
233,"According to the best-fit model parameters, the basic reproduction number for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 varies between 1.4 in the summer and 2 in the winter, the duration of immunity for both strains is about 40 weeks, and each strain induces cross-immunity against the other, though the cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 infection induces against HCoV-HKU1 is stronger than the reverse.

Next, we incorporated a third betacoronavirus into the dynamic transmission model to represent SARS-CoV-2"
234,"We assumed that the incubation period and infectious period for SARS-CoV-2 were the same as the best-fit values for the other betacoronaviruses (5.0 and 4.9 days, respectively; see Table S7 ), in agreement with other estimates (23) (24) (25) "
235,"For a representative set of parameter values within these ranges, we measured the annual incidence proxy due to SARS-CoV-2 ( Table 1, Tables S2-3 ) and the annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreak peak size (Tables S4-6) for the five years following the simulated time of establishment"
236,"We summarized the post-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic outbreaks, or virtual elimination"
237,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112 doi: medRxiv preprint infection due to SARS-CoV-2, and autumn establishments and smaller seasonal fluctuations in transmissibility were associated with larger pandemic peak sizes"
238,"Model simulations demonstrated the following few key points:

i) SARS-CoV-2 can proliferate at any time of year"
239,"In all modeled scenarios, SARS-CoV-2 was capable of producing a substantial outbreak regardless of establishment time.

Winter/spring establishments favored longer-lasting outbreaks with shorter peaks (Fig 3A) , while autumn/winter establishments led to more acute outbreaks (Fig 3B) "
240,"The five-year cumulative incidence proxies were comparable for all establishment times ( Table 1) .

ii) If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not permanent, it will likely enter into regular circulation.

Much like pandemic influenza, many scenarios lead to SARS-CoV-2 entering into long-term circulation alongside the other human betacoronaviruses (e.g"
241,"Short-term immunity (on the order of 40 weeks, similar to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) favors the establishment of annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, while longer-term immunity (two years) favors biennial outbreaks if establishment occurs in the winter or spring and sporadic outbreaks if establishment occurs in the summer or autumn.

iii) If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is permanent, the virus could disappear for five or more years after causing a major outbreak"
242,Long-term immunity consistently led to effective elimination of SARS-CoV-2 and lower overall incidence of infection
243,"If SARS-CoV-2 induces cross immunity against HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, the incidence of all betacoronaviruses could decline and even virtually disappear (Fig 3C) "
244,"The virtual elimination of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 would be possible if SARS-CoV-2 induced 70% cross immunity against them, which is the same estimated level of cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 induces against HCoV-HKU1.

could make SARS-CoV-2 appear to die out, only to resurge after a few years"
245,"Even if SARS-CoV-2 immunity only lasts for two years, mild (30%) cross-immunity from HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 could effectively eliminate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for up to three years before a resurgence in 2025, as long as SARS-CoV-2 does not fully die out (Fig 3D) "
246,"The establishment of sustained transmission can be delayed by rapidly detecting and isolating introduced cases (1).

Our observations are consistent with other predictions of how the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak might unfold"
247,"According to a study of geographic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number across China, seasonal variations in absolute humidity will be insufficient to prevent the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (26) "
248,"A modelling study using data from Sweden also found that seasonal establishment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely in the post-pandemic period (10).

Our study was subject to a variety of limitations"
249,"The transmission model is deterministic, so it cannot capture the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 extinction.

Accurately quantifying the probability of SARS-CoV-2 extinction would depend on many factors for which sufficient evidence is currently lacking"
250,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112 doi: medRxiv preprint evidence from SARS, the most closely related coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2"
251,"However, we expect that if post-pandemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 does take hold in temperate regions, there will also be continued transmission in tropical regions seeded by the seasonal outbreaks to the north and south"
252,"With such reseeding, longterm disappearance of any strain becomes less likely (30) , but according to our model the effective reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 remains below 1 during most of each period when that strain disappears, meaning that reseeding would shorten these disappearances only modestly.

Our findings indicate key pieces of information that are still required to know how the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will unfold"
253,"Most crucially, longitudinal serological studies from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 could indicate whether or not immunity wanes, and at what rate"
254,"According to our projections, this rate is the key modulator of the total SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the coming years"
255,"Furthermore, our findings underscore the need to maintain SARS-CoV-2 surveillance even if the outbreak appears to die out after the first pandemic wave, as a resurgence in infection could be possible as late as 2025.

In summary, the total incidence of COVID-19 illness over the next five years will depend critically upon whether or not it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave, which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that SARS-CoV-2 infection imparts"
256,"The intensity and timing of pandemic and post-pandemic outbreaks will depend on the time of year when widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes established and, to a lesser degree, upon the magnitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility and the level of crossimmunity that exists between the betacoronaviruses"
257,"Longitudinal serological studies are urgently required to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and epidemiological surveillance should be maintained in the coming years to anticipate the possibility of resurgence.

262,"The model-based effective reproduction number was calculated as the product of the basic reproduction number and the proportion of susceptible individuals in the population at time t, accounting for crossimmunity (37).

Next, we incorporated a third strain into the dynamic transmission model to represent SARS-CoV-2"
263,"Using the maximum likelihood parameter values, we simulated transmission of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 for 20 years and then simulated the establishment of sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission using another half-week pulse in the force of infection"
264,"We assumed that the incubation period and infectious period for SARS-CoV-2 were the same as the best-fit values for the other betacoronaviruses (5.0 and 4.9 days, respectively; see Table S7 ), in broad agreement with other estimates (23) (24) (25) "
265,"We allowed the cross immunities, duration of immunity, degree of seasonal variation in R0, and establishment time of SARS-CoV-2 to vary"
266,"In particular, we allowed the cross immunity from SARS-CoV-2 to the other betacoronaviruses to range from 0 to 1, the cross immunity from the other betacoronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 to range from 0 to 0.5 (following the observation that SARS infection can induce long-lasting neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-OC43 but not vice-versa (15)),the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 to range from 40 weeks to permanent, the seasonal variation in R0 to vary between none and equivalent to the other human betacoronaviruses, and the establishment time to vary throughout 2020"

289,The sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 poses a huge threat to human health worldwide
290,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe respiratory disease that can quickly spread from person to person and in some cases lead to death.

Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] "
291,"In recent epidemiological investigations of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and a preliminary study of the clinical characteristics of this disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , researchers have found that patients infected with the new coronavirus have severe symptoms similar to those of the SARS infection"
292,"The first batch of clinical data reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China revealed ""cytokine storms"" in critically ill patients [7, 8] "
293,"For example, TWIRLS found 100 CSSEs close to ACE2, the receptor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (see left panel in Figure 1 )"
294,"For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3).

Specifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus)"
295,"Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus"
296,"After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis"
297,"WHO, in its first emergency meeting (World-Health-Organization, 2020a), estimated the fatality rate of COVID-19 to be around 4%.

Worldwide collaborative efforts from scientists are underway to understand the novel and rapidly spreading virus that causes this disease, SARS-CoV-2 (originally tentatively named 2019-nCoV), and to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing it (Heymann, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Xin Liu & Wang, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .

Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae.

These viruses mostly infect animals, including birds and mammals"
298,"However, some recent human Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus (Lu et al., 2020) "
299,"With SARS-CoV-2 being discovered very recently, there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus (e.g., information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or T cell responses)"
300,"Preliminary studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) , and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko & Munster, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) "
301,"Due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.

Various reports related to SARS-CoV suggest a protective role of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses"
302,"Further, of the structural proteins, T cell responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting (Channappanavar, Fett, Zhao, Meyerholz, & Perlman, 2014) .

Here, by analysing available experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes (both linear and discontinuous) and T cell epitopes, we identify and report those that are completely identical and comprise no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020)"
303,"These epitopes have the potential, therefore, to elicit a cross-reactive/effective response against SARS-CoV-2"
304,"Our presented results can potentially narrow down the search for potent targets for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and help guide experimental studies focused on vaccine development.

Acquisition and processing of sequence data"
305,"These nucleotide sequences were aligned to the GenBank reference sequence (accession ID: NC_045512.2) and then translated into amino acid residues according to the coding sequence positions provided along the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (orf1a, orf1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, and ORF10)"
306,"We used the publicly available software PASTA v1.6.4 [28] to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of each structural protein using the unique set of sequences in the available data of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2"
307,"Each constructed tree was rooted with the outgroup Zaria Bat coronavirus strain, and circular phylogram layout was used.

SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be close to SARS-CoV-much more so than MERS-CoV-based on full-length genome phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) "
308,"A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) (Figure 1a )"
309,"The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins ( Figure 1a ); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b) "
310,"It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004.

Given the close genetic similarity between the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we attempted to leverage immunological studies of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV to potentially aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2"
311,We used the available SARS-CoV-derived experimentally-determined epitope data (see Materials and Methods) and searched to identify T cell and B cell epitopes that were identicaland hence potentially cross-reactive-across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
312,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.933226 doi: bioRxiv preprint Mapping the SARS-CoV-derived T cell epitopes that are identical in SARS-CoV-2, and determining those with greatest estimated population coverage"
313,We aligned these T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences
314,"Among the 115 T cell epitopes that were determined by positive T cell assays (Table 1) , we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within SARS-CoV-2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020) ( Table 2) "
315,"MHC binding assays were performed for 19 of these 27 epitopes, and these were reported to be associated with only MHC binding tests to identify the MHC alleles that bind to these 8 epitopes may reveal additional distinct alleles, beyond the five determined so far, that may help to improve population coverage.

To further expand the search and identify potentially effective T cell targets covering a higher percentage of the population, we next additionally considered the set of T cell epitopes that have been experimentally-determined from positive MHC binding assays (Table 1) , but, unlike the previous epitope set, their ability to induce a T cell response against SARS-CoV was not experimentally determined.

Nonetheless, they also present promising candidates for inducing a response against SARS-CoV-2.

For the expanded set of epitopes, all of which have at least one positive MHC binding assay, we found that 264 epitope-sequences have an identical match in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and have associated MHC allele information available (listed in Table S2 )"
316,"These epitopes were classified as: (i) linear B cell epitopes (antigenic peptides), and (ii) discontinuous B cell epitopes (conformational epitopes with resolved structural determinants).

We aligned the 298 linear B cell epitopes (Table 1) across the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that 50 epitope-sequences, all derived from structural proteins, have an identical match and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (as of 9 February 2020)"
317,"Based on the pairwise alignment between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences ( Figure S2 ), we found that none of these mapped identically to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, in contrast to the linear epitopes"
318,"For 3 of these discontinuous B cell epitopes there was a partial mapping, with at least one site having an identical residue at the corresponding site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Table 5) .

Mapping the residues of the B cell epitopes onto the available structure of the SARS-CoV S protein revealed that the linear epitopes (Table 4 ) map to seemingly less-exposed regions, away from the most exposed region, the ""spike head"" (Figure 3a) "
319,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.933226 doi: bioRxiv preprint within the receptor-binding motif are identical within SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3b )
320,"It has been reported recently that SARS-CoV-2 is able to bind to the same receptor as SARS-CoV (ACE2) for cell entry, despite having multiple amino acid differences with SARS-CoV's receptor-binding motif (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko & Munster, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) "
321,"Whether the antibodies specific to this motif maintain their binding and elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 warrants further experimental investigation.

The quest for a vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as an urgent problem"
322,"At this early stage, there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, which presents a challenge for vaccine development.

This study has sought to assist with the initial phase of vaccine development, by providing recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in subunit vaccine designs"
323,"Despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to SARS-CoV-2, these epitopes are motivated by their responses that they have recorded in SARS-CoV (or, for the case of T cell epitopes, to at least confer MHC binding), and the fact that they map identically to SARS-CoV-2, based on the available sequence data (as of 9 February 2020)"
324,"The identical map between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of any mutation in the identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), suggests their potential for eliciting a robust T cell or antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.

Research efforts directed towards the design and development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are increasing, and some related analyses are already being reported in distinct, parallel studies"
325,"While only a summary of the results has been provided so far, preventing direct comparison of the individual epitopes, the number of linear B cell epitopes reported to map identically to SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to our findings.

A recent study has also predicted T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 that may be presented by a population from the Asia-Pacific region (Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020) "
326,"Second, computational tools were used to predict MHC Class II epitopes in (Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020) , while here we analysed the SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that have been determined experimentally, using either positive T cell or MHC binding assays, and which match identically with the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020).

We acknowledge that this is a preliminary analysis based on the limited sequence data available for SARS-CoV-2 (as of 9 February 2020)"
327,"If mutations do occur within epitope regions, then these epitopes may be further screened in line with the conservative filtering principle that we have employed, thereby producing a more refined epitope set.

Further experimental studies (T cell and B cell assays) are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2"
328,"Overall, as the identified set of epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, they present potentially useful candidates for guiding experimental efforts towards developing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

All sequence and immunological data, and all scripts for reproducing the results are available at https://github.com/faraz107/2019-nCoV-T-Cell-Vaccine-Candidates"

353,"Background: A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spread from the capital of the Hubei province in China to the rest of the country, then to most of the world"
354,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) , a novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 in humans, began to occur in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 and has the trend of spreading around the world [1, 2, 3] "
355,"It was confirmed by etiology that SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the novel coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B), and had 79.5% similarity with SARS-CoV [4] , which caused the global outbreak in 2003"
356,"Spike (S) protein, one of the main structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein of the host cell membrane to fuse into the cell for nucleic acid replication just similar to SARS-CoV [5] "
357,"Through a variety of bioinformatics and experimental verification, ACE2 is not only expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, but also in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, testis and other organs, which means that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to enter other tissues and organs through ACE2 binding, causing multiple organ damage [6, 7] .

In recent studies, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to cause heart, kidney, liver injury and gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to lung lesions such as ARDS [6] "
358,"Combined with clinical data, we demonstrated the pancreatic injury in some patients with COVID-19, and explained for the first time that the pancreas was also a vulnerable organ after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We collected bulk RNA-seq data from GTEx (https://gtexportal.org), which contains normal tissue and organ sequencing data from multiple individuals"
359,"1A) , which suggests that these organs or tissues such as unreported ovary and thyroid might also be targets for SARS-CoV-2.

For comparison, we compared ACE2 expression in lung and pancreatic tissues, since the lung is known to be the first target organ to be attacked by SARS-CoV-2"
360,"These data still indicate that ACE2 is expressed in both the exocrine glands and islets, which may be the main potential part targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in the pancreas, resulting in "
361,"So far, there is no specific drug for SARS-CoV-2, and challenges remain"
362,"Although there are asymptomatic infected people, who can also be the source of transmission [1, 12] , in clinical practice, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 mainly suffer from systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue, respiratory symptoms like cough and expectoration, digestive symptoms such as diarrhea [2, 13] "
363,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029181 doi: medRxiv preprint expression of protein ACE2 in these organs may provide an approach for SARS-CoV-2 infection [7] , leading to tissue injuries"
364,"However, the injury of pancreas has been ignored in clinic, since the symptoms of mild pancreatic injury are not specific to other systemic lesions, such as fever, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.

In this study, we focused on the expression of ACE2 in pancreas and the damage to the pancreas in a proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection"
365,"Firstly, we found ACE2 was mostly expressed in the pancreas of normal people, and it was slightly higher in the pancreas than in the lungs, indicating that when SARS-CoV-2 appeared in the circulation, it might also combine with ACE2 in the pancreas to enter cells and cause pancreatic injury"
366,"At the same time, analysis results from scRNA-seq data were consistent with elevated levels of amylase and lipase in the plasma of our patients.

In our cases, about 1-2% of the non-severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 had pancreatic lesions, and about 17% of the severe patients suffered from pancreatic injuries, which was not previously noticed"
367,"Since SARS-CoV-2 has the same receptor as SARS-COV, whether this result will occur requires more attention.

Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the pancreas in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in severe cases.

In our study, there are still some limitations"
368,"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently emerged life-threatening viral pneumonia disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (named 2019-nCoV before February 11, 2020) (1) "

370,"So far, the full-length genomic sequences between virus samples are almost identical (3) , suggesting that no significant mutations have occurred in the virus (5) .

There is no suitable antiviral drug or effective vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus currently"
371,"Therefore, reliable and rapid laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to managing patient care and preventing hospital transmission"
372,Real-time reverse-transcription fluorescent PCR (RT-PCR) is the clinical standard for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection (8) 
373,"Now, in order to detect SARS-CoV-2 early and control the disease spreading on time, we developed a faster and more convenient method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, named RT-LAMP (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification)"
374,"When the template is RNA, the amplification reaction can be occurred in one step by adding reverse transcriptase, and called RT-LAMP.

Magnesium pyrophosphate is produced as a by-product during DNA amplification.

Because the amplification efficiency of LAMP is higher than that of RT-PCR, a large amount of magnesium pyrophosphate causes the reaction solution to become cloudy.

Besides, the added dye calcein can change the mixed solution from orange to green, so the results can not only be observed by a turbidimeter, but also by the naked eye.

Because RT-LAMP is convenient and fast, it shows significant advantages in SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinic (14) "
375,"Sensitivity, specificity and application potential of RT-LAMP in the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 were reported and discussed here.

384,Results showed that their sensitivity was similar for SARS-CoV-2 judgment
385,"Although the RT-PCR kit used also detects three genes, one band appears because the three gene fragments are all about 100 bp.

RT-LAMP has one more dilution than RT-PCR, and because there are several bright bands in one electrophoretic lane, it indicates that the amount of RT-LAMP products is very large, which is the reason that the RT-LAMP results are visible by naked eyes.

It was verified that influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus-positive specimens did not interfere SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-LAMP"
386,SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious
387,"However, the N gene alone cannot be judged as positive for SARS-CoV-2, and it needs to be re-examined in order to determine with other genes.

Through the combined detection of the three genes, the N gene can detect a low concentration of the virus, so that possible positives are not missed, and the ORF1ab gene guarantees that no false positives appear, which also ensures the sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 test"
388,"However, if one of the three genes is used alone, it can reduce the sensitivity or specificity of the test, causing false positives or false negatives.

In summary, the single-step RT-LAMP measurement reported in this paper is simple, fast, and accurate, and has practicality for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in clinical.

In the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, RT-PCR for pharyngeal and CT scan is the main Besides that, we also analyze the agreement of the two methods (The cases with uncertain CT results were not involved in statistical analysis due to statistical limitations)"
392,"The average time of nucleic acid screening was earlier than that of CT scan statistically (-0.7390days, -3625~1.674) ( Table 4) It is notable that both of the methods acquired the sensitivity less than 80% in screening SARS-CoV-22 infections, which is not ideal enough for the diagnosis of infectious diseases with severe consequences"
393,"15 findings from a severely infected COVID-19 patient revealed no obvious histological changes in heart tissue; however, the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 infection might not directly impair the heart is debatable because this finding was observed in only one patient without AMI-related clinical evidences"

According to random drift hypothesis (15) ， these nucleotide mutations among different SARS-CoV-2 strains now available are still determined by neutral evolution"

410,"However, we should take strict precautions against the strong factors that may cause directional variation of SARS-CoV-2 both in natural environment and infection treatment.

To investigate whether the mutation pattern between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is unique across all coronavirus species, we further compared their alterations of nucleotides and amino acids in comparison to other representative coronaviruses"

Through comprehensive comparative analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we found the synonymous mutations is dramatically elevated between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 than that of other coronavirus strains, and the nucleotide mutations were enriched in T:C transition.

The specific mutation pattern may caused by the loss function of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN)"
422,"Moreover, as the SARS-CoV-2 was supposed to be originated from Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the increased synonymous substitution between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strain suggested the SARS-CoV-2 genome was under stronger negative (purifying) selection"

460,"In PUA, SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentrations were below 3 copies m -3 , except for two occasions: one crowd gathering site near the entrance of a department store with frequent customer flow and one outdoor site next to Renmin Hospital with outpatients and passengers passing by"
461,"The peak concentration of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols appears in two distinct size ranges, one in the submicron region with aerodynamic diameter dominant between 0.25 to 1.0 µm, and the other peak in supermicron region with diameter larger than 2.5 µm"
462,The two concentration peaks in sub-and supermicron ranges have independent existence in SARS-CoV-2 aerosols and they do not necessarily co-exist indicating possible different formation mechanisms
463,"The aerosol deposition sample collected from the Renmin Hospital ICU room had raw counts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA significantly above the detection limit as shown in Table S1 , although the TSP aerosol sample concentration inside this ICU room was below detection limit during the 3 hour sampling period"

MSAs in general have higher concentration of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol with biomodal size distributions compared to PAA in both hospitals during the first batch of sampling in the peak of COVID-19 outbreak"
470,"While for Fangcang Hospital, the nonventilated temporary PARR has limited air penetration from the patient hall where the SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentration was generally low"
471,We believe one direct source of the high SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentration may be the resuspension of virus-laden aerosol from the surface of medical staff protective apparel while they are being removed
472,"These resuspended virus-laden aerosol originally may come from the direct deposition of respiratory droplets or virus-laden aerosol onto the protective apparel while medical staff having long working hours inside PAA, as shown from the SARS-CoV-2 deposition results in ICU room"
473,"The comparison of the two batches of samples showed the effectiveness and importance of sanitization in reducing the airborne SARS-CoV-2 in high risk areas.

In PUA outside the hospitals, we found the majority of the sites have undetectable or very low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol, except for one crowd gathering site about 1 meter to the entrance of a department store with customers frequently passing through, and the other site next to Renmin Hospital where the outpatients and passengers passed by"

As the essential elements of virus transmission, the expression of virus receptor ACE2 in target organs is another determining factor for fetus vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.

We then screened the ACE2 expression in multiple fetal organs including heart, lungs, liver and kidneys based on the online published single cell transcriptome studies"
524,"The data showed the evidence of abundant expression of ACE2 in the main human fetal organs.

Since the respiratory system undergoes a series of structural and functional changes necessary for adaptation to air breathing at birth, and lung is a major organ to be attacked by SARS-CoV-2 virus, the dynamic changes of pulmonary cells gene expression is necessary to be investigated before and after birth to predict the potential infection of fetal and neonatal individuals"

575,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.08.20032847 doi: medRxiv preprint not expected to advance sooner unless more stringent measures are implemented to control the contagion.

Finally, depending on the effectiveness of treatment, recovery rates vary, and judging from the predicted trends shown in Figures 2, 4 and 6 , the epidemic progressions for the three countries are expected to subside by the end of May, with South Korea expected to recover sooner than the others.

The spreading of the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) has evolved from a contagion originally confined within Wuhan, China, in December 2019, rapidly to a global contagion, which has spread to 87 countries within two months"
576,A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in China in late-December 2019
577,"Facemask wearing is considered as one of the most cost-effective and important measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but it became a social concern due to the recent global facemask shortage"
578,The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and can be transmitted between humans 1-3 
579,"Most of the confirmed cases are travellers from or ever been to Wuhan or other Chinese cities; however, locally transmitted cases outside of China have also been reported 7 .

The World Health Organization's (WHO) guidance on prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak recommends hand, and respiratory hygiene and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment for healthcare workers in practice and patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should be offered a medical mask 8 "
580,"Regarding the respiratory hygiene measures, facemask wearing is considered as one of the most cost-effective and important measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but it became a social concern due to the recent global facemask shortage 9-12 .

China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of the global production 9 "
581,"We assumed the percentage of the general population wearing facemasks (P g (d) ) to be close to 0% before the release of the national technical protocol for SARS-CoV-2 (the first version) by the NHC (i.e., 0<d≤16) 2 "
582,"The P g (d) was assumed to be 20% after the NHC recommended facemasks wearing in the national technical protocol (the first version) (16<d≤23), and 60% after the release of the national technical protocol for SARS-CoV-2 (the second version) and massive media cover (23<d≤25) 21 "
583,This novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes pneumonia in patients 2 and it has 32 rapidly spread to other provinces in China and other countries 3 
584,"The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, 35 which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV"
585,Further sequence analyses of this novel and 38 other betacoronaviruses might provide additional information to better understand the 39 evolution of SARS-CoV-2
586,We found SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARSr-CoV have similar 58 amino acid usage
587,"However, our analyses suggested that the spike and member genes of 59 SARS-CoV-2 have rather distinct synonymous codon usage patterns"
588,"159 Of all the four correspondence analyses for the four genes, the extracted first factors 160 explained more than 50% of the total variance (see Supplementary Figure S4 The global codon usages of bat RatG13 virus were found most similar to SARS-CoV-2 in 196 orf1ab, spike and nucleocapsid genes, but not in membrane gene ( Figure"
589,"In the analysis 197 of membrane protein, pangolin P1E virus had a more similar codon usage to SARS-CoV-2 198 than all the other viruses"
590,"We found the similarity in codon usage between pangolin P1E and 199 SARS-CoV-2 were also high in orf1ab, where P1E was the second closest data point to 200 SARS-CoV-2"
591,218 Results from the BCA suggested that the amino acid usage of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related 219 to bat and human SARSr-CoVs in all four genes ( Figure 3B and Figure 4B )
592,"Specifically, we 220 discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 had amino acid usage pattern most similar to bat RaTG13 Figure S8A )"
593,It is evident that the synonymous codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is 243 distinct from other bat origin coronaviruses
594,"249 It is worth noting that comparing to RaTG13, P1E and CoVZXC21 had lower synonymous 250 codon usage similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the other three genes"
595,"251 Overall, our WCA results support a more complex synonymous codon usage background on 252 spike and membrane genes, though we identified unique codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-253 2 on these two genes"
596,"In our results, the synonymous codon 304 usage of SARS-CoV-2 in spike gene was distinct from those of RaTG13 and other 305 phylogenetic relatives ( Figure 3A) , which was not observed in orf1ab or nucleocapsid gene"
597,"306 Although the codon usage in spike of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E were similar at amino 307 acid level, the difference at synonymous codon usage level indicates that they are unlikely to 308 share a very recent common ancestor"
598,"It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E 309 might have undergone different evolution pathways for a certain period of time"
599,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.15.950568 doi: bioRxiv preprint acid usage of SARS-CoV-2 in membrane was clustered with bat SARSr-CoV, however the 311 synonymous codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 was still distinct to these bat coronaviruses"
600,"312 Notably, in membrane gene, pangolin P1E had a more similar synonymous codon usage to 313 SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13"
601,Our result supports different evolutionary background or currently 315 unknown host adaption history in SARS-CoV-2
602,"The codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in 316 nucleocapsid gene was similar to bat SARSr-CoV both at amino acid level and synonymous 317 level, suggesting that no highly significant mutation happened in this gene"
603,Some researchers have hypothesised that the codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 320 maybe directly correlated to the codon usage of its host 28 
604,"A novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (family: Coronaviridae ), is the virus behind a severe outbreak originating in China [1] "
605,SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is essential to slowing widespread transmission
606,"In January 2020, we quickly made available a capture enrichment panel [2] using CATCH [3] that is aimed at enhancing sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses"
607,"Capture has also been important for ongoing SARS-like coronavirus surveillance [4] , and the panel's inclusion of SARS-like bat and pangolin coronaviruses can aid surveillance efforts.

There are several challenges associated with surveillance during the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak"
608,"Second, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other important coronavirus subspecies and species, so detection assays can yield false positives if they are not exquisitely specific to SARS-CoV-2"
609,"Third, suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients sometimes have a different respiratory viral infection or have co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses [7] "
610,"Therefore, it is important to characterize these other pathogens, for both patient diagnostics and outbreak response.

Here, we help address the challenge of identifying SARS-CoV-2 and the numerous other respiratory viral pathogens by reporting a set of comprehensive design options for 67 species and subspecies for CRISPR-based detection assays"
611,"We have not yet experimentally tested most of these designs, instead focusing our efforts so far on extensively testing a point-of-care assay for SARS-CoV-2 using the Cas13-based SHERLOCK technology [6, 8, 9] "
612,"Using this assay, we demonstrate sensitive detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 10 copies per microliter.

We have been developing algorithms and machine learning models for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays, linked in a system called ADAPT (manuscript in preparation)"
613,"• Predicted specificity : Assays have high predicted specificity to their species or subspecies, factoring in the full extent of known strain diversity, allowing them to be grouped into panels that are accurate in differentiating between related taxa.

Comprehensiveness and-to some extent-specificity of the designs can be verified in silico .

Using ADAPT we designed 67 assays, satisfying the above constraints, to identify: the SARS-related coronavirus species; SARS-CoV-2; two other subspecies in that species with high similarity to SARS-CoV-2; all other known Coronaviridae species, including 4 other species that commonly cause human illness; and other common respiratory viral species and subspecies ( Table 1 ) "
614,"SARS-CoV-2 is designed to exclude detection of the highly similar RaTG13 sequence, and other similar bat and pangolin SARS-like coronaviruses; the SARS-like subspecies includes most bat and pangolin SARS-like coronaviruses.

We initially screened a set of 4 designs for SHERLOCK [6, 8, 9] assays, output by ADAPT to detect SARS-CoV-2"
615,This assay performs well in comparison to the recently disclosed DETECTR [10] assay (sensitivity: 70-300 cp/µl) [11] and SHERLOCK assay (10-100 cp/µl) [12] for SARS-CoV-2
616,"

Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing is key to developing and monitoring diagnostics and similar surveillance tools"
617,"In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, genomes have been generated and shared at a remarkable pace, and we thank those who have contributed their data through GISAID [13]"
618,"We and others, relying on this data [14] , have shown that it is possible to rapidly design CRISPR-based tools for detection and surveillance during an outbreak.

Among other goals for this work, we plan to evaluate: (1) sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 assay against clinical isolates and patient samples-including sputum, throat, and nasal swabs-some of which may be challenging sample types to test; (2) specificity at both the species and subspecies levels against highly related viruses"
619,"Combining a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December and February 2020"
620,"We then used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases are introduced.

Evidence before this study: We searched PubMed, BioRxiv and MedRxiv for articles published up to 10 th February 2020 using the keywords ""2019-nCoV"", ""novel coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""reproduction number"", ""R0"", ""transmission"""
621,"This creates a substantial risk of outbreaks in other countries, although if SARS-CoV-2 has MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like variability in "
622,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019901 doi: medRxiv preprint

Combining a mathematical model with multiple datasets, we found that the median daily reproduction number, R t , of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan likely varied between 1.6-2.6 in January 2020 prior to travel restrictions being introduced"
623,"We found some evidence of reduction in R t in the days prior to the introduction of travel restrictions in Wuhan, which may have been reflected outbreak control efforts or growing awareness of SARS-CoV-2 during this period"
624,"This may be the result of increased surveillance and detected as awareness of SARS-CoV-2 grew in late January, which would suggest earlier exported cases may have missed; it may also be the result of increased travel out of Wuhan immediately prior to travel restrictions being introduced on 23rd January.

Based our on estimated reproduction number, and published estimates of individuallevel variation in transmission for SARS and MERS-CoV, we found that a single case introduced to a new location would not necessarily lead to an outbreak"
625,"We used plausible biological parameters for SARS-CoV-2 based on current evidence, but these values may be refined as more comprehensive data become available"
626,"However, by fitting to multiple datasets to infer model parameters, and performing sensitivity analyses on key areas of uncertainty, we have attempted to make the best possible use of the available evidence about SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics"
627,"However, there is evidence that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur with limited reported symptoms (25) "
628,"However, it remains unclear what the precise extent of such variation is for SARS-CoV-2 (13); if transmission were more homogenous than SARS of MERS-CoV, it would increase the risk of outbreaks following introduced cases"
629,"As more data becomes available, it will be possible to refine these estimates, and therefore we made an online tool so users can explore these risk estimates if new data become available (Appendix, page 4) Our results demonstrate that there was likely substantial variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission over time, and suggest a decline in transmission in Wuhan in late January around the time that control measures were introduced"
630,"1 As of 24 Feb 2020, 119 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 15 countries are publicly available from over 79,331 confirmed cases"
631,"While unbiased sequencing successfully achieved an unambiguous identification of the virus in the absence of any sequence enrichment, complete coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was subsequently achieved by augmenting the mNGS library preparation via a spiked primer enrichment approach"
632,"Extracted RNA samples were DNAse-treated and tested via real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 using both the Charité Virology and Hong Kong University protocols and confirmed positive on January 27 th , 2020"
633,Geneious Prime 2020.0.5 was used for separate de novo assembly and annotation of the draft SARS-CoV-2 genome
634,"In subsequent runs to achieve higher coverage of the viral genome, two additional steps were taken: 1) the subsampling filter of the nonhost reads was removed and 2) targeted enrichment of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence using author/funder"
635,"6

By February 1, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was correctly identified in the index COVID-19 patient sample using mNGS and globally accessible bioinformatics"
636,"When processed on IDseq pipeline version 3.18 with a February 2020 NCBI index, which included 54 SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited by the international research community, sequences from the index patient aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome ( Figure 1A , 582 reads, at 100% identity to the reference sequence; NCBI accession MN985325.1)"
637,Further analysis resulted in 33.2% coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 reference at an average depth of 2.2x ( Figure 1B )
638,Assembly and alignment on Geneious resulted in 50.5% coverage at 2.6x of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (NCBI accession MN908947.1)
639,"Re-sequencing the index case to a total sequencing depth of 8,786,916 single reads resulted in a greater number of SARS-CoV-2 alignments (819 reads) but had no impact on overall coverage -32.3% coverage breadth at an average depth of 2.7x.

Using the target enrichment strategy, the overall fold enrichment was 6.4x"
640,"In terms of improving genome coverage, particularly at the 5' end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the resulting 3,077 reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2 assembled into a single contig which provided full coverage of the reference genome at an average depth of 14.9x ( Figure 1C )(NCBI accession MN988668.1).

All human SARS-CoV-2 genomes are very similar, including the SARS-CoV-2 genome from the Cambodian case as we would expect given that he transited directly from Wuhan"
641,The index Cambodian SARS-CoV-2 sequence data uploaded to public databases represent one of the only sequences generated in a low-to-middle income country close to the outbreak epicenter
642,"8 As cases of COVID-19 spread globally in mid-January, initial real-time PCR protocols took into account that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in humans and animals was not completely known"
643,"To overcome this barrier, our follow-up steps included a target enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 while keeping the comprehensiveness of our mNGS pipeline intact"
644,"Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, high systemic immune-inflammation index, and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

SARS-CoV-2 causes a cluster of severe respiratory illness which is similar to another two fatal coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV"
645,"These damages might be attributable to indirect cytokines storm initiated by immune system and direct attack from SARS-CoV-2 itself.

651,"First, ACE2 expression is also found in the kidney, heart, and liver etc, therefore SARS-CoV-2 could invade the cells of above tissues, reproduce and damage these organ"
652,"19, 20 A recent study showed high levels of IL-1β, interferon γ -induced protein 10 , and MCP-1 occurred in serum of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, which probably leaded to the activation of T-helper-1 cell response 1 "
653,"These results, consistent with the previous findings found in the patients with severe illness, suggest perturbation of immune system contribute the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2"
654,"Lung injury begins with an insult to the lung epithelium mainly attacked by SARS-CoV-2 itself because of ACE2 expressed in the lungs, which leads to most common respiratory failure"

659,The sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 poses a huge threat to human health worldwide
660,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe respiratory disease that can quickly spread from person to person and in some cases lead to death.

Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] "
661,"In recent epidemiological investigations of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and a preliminary study of the clinical characteristics of this disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , researchers have found that patients infected with the new coronavirus have severe symptoms similar to those of the SARS infection"
662,"The first batch of clinical data reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China revealed ""cytokine storms"" in critically ill patients [7, 8] "

Specifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus)"
665,"Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus"
666,"After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis"
667,"Therefore, this virus was named SARS-CoV-2, and recently WHO named it coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"
668,"However, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurological manifestations.

Here, we would like to report the characteristic neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 78 of 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and treated at our hospitals, which are located in the epicenter of Wuhan.

This was a retrospective study"

671,"The significance threshold was set at a P<0.05.

A total of 214 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the present analysis"
672,"Moreover, during the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with these neurologic manifestations, doctors should consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a differential diagnosis so to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and prevention of transmission.

Recently, ACE2 is identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [3] , which is present in multiple human organs, including nervous system and skeletal muscle [11] "
673,"The expression and distribution of ACE2 remind us that the SARS-CoV-2 may cause some neurological symptoms through direct or indirect mechanisms.

the cerebrospinal fluid of those patients and also in their brain tissue on autopsy [12] [13] .

CNS symptoms were the main form of neurological injury in patients with COVID-19 in this study"
674,"The pathological mechanism may be from the CNS invasion of SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS and MERS virus"
675,"However, SARS-CoV, using the same receptor, was not detected in skeletal muscle by post-mortem examination [15] .

Therefore, whether SARS-CoV-2 infects skeletal muscle cells by binding with ACE2 requires to be further studied"
676,"Significantly In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 may infect nervous system, skeletal muscle as well as respiratory tract"
677,"The cause of the pneumonia cases was identified as a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, recently renamed as SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease COVID-19)"

684,[11] reported the complex structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with human host cell binding receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
685,[12] reported crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) region binding with ACE2
686,"However, all proteins mentioned above are engineered in laboratory by recombinant expression system, not from real virus and the structure as whole of virion is thus still lacking.

Furthermore, safety is one of the major factors that restricts virus study of SARS-CoV-2 due to a high risk of possible transmission, live viruses must be operated in Biosafety

696,"In the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the clinical features of patients with COVID-19 at symptom onset mostly manifest as fever, dry cough, myalgia and fatigue, with or without diarrhea"
697,"Since the 3 rd and 4 rd -generation transmission and even asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 have appeared, 4, 8 it is urgent to distinguish the differences in clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients at admission during diverse infection periods.

In this study, we observed a small proportion of female patients admitted before January 23, considering that the sample size is not large, it is difficult to account for this phenomenon"
698,"Some common systemic symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, fatigue, sputum and myalgia, were more prominent in the patients admitted before January 23, but they were more insidious in patients admitted later.

However, there is still no convincing evidence to predict whether the transmission and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 will weaken during transmission"
699,"As the ""close relatives"" of SARS-CoV-2, previous studies have shown that the interpersonal transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were constantly changing"
700,"Therefore, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in different periods should be observed in detail.

Research has confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), 10-12 and ACE2 is highly expressed in nasopharyngeal cells"
701,Research and clinical findings seem to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be colonized in the nasopharynx but has failed to be recognized in the early stage
702,"As a result, SARS-CoV-2 could hardly be removed by self-cleaning responses such as sneeze and runny and could not be cleared immediately by the local immune system; thus, the initial symptoms of COVID-19 are insidious"
703,"8 All of these results indicated that the less obvious respiratory symptoms in early infected patients may be due to the existence of pathogenic latency of SARS-CoV-2.

In addition, our study found that a larger proportion of the patients admitted earlier had decreased lymphocyte, CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in the peripheral blood"
704,"Overall, changes in symptoms and laboratory results at admission reflect that SARS-CoV-2 may be undergoing a certain degree of modification, and infection in patients seems to be more insidious"
705,"Therefore, we propose that it may be of great significance in guiding the diagnosis and prevention of COVID-19 in the future if respiratory samples, especially lower respiratory samples, could be collected to detect the content of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 in patients infected at different periods.

More notably, as of now, 3 unique patients have appeared in our unit"
706,"All of them reached the discharge standard (SARS-CoV-2 negativity detected on different days), but a re-examination of their throat swabs showed positive infection days after discharge"

736,"The application of the ""3+2"" diagnostic method was conducive to the effective control of the source of infection and was a key point to improve SARS-CoV-2 prevention and control.

It has showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, using S-protein interacts with human ACE2, thereby infecting human respiratory epithelial cells, causing immune and inflammatory responses, and then producing cytokines and inflammatory mediators, such as IL1β, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, et al [25] "
737,"Thus, studies excluding those patients may not actually reflect the real picture of clinical and epidemiological feature of SARS-CoV-2 infected population"
738,"Subsequently, rapid humanto-human transmission of the disease was confirmed in January 2020, and the etiological agent was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to its genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV discovered in 2003 (4, 5) "

Within-outbreak SARS-CoV-2 sequence divergence and clusters, China and Thailand, January 2020 

According to the cases' history, the two imported COVID- 19 People travelling out of the city since then may have spread the virus further before travel restrictions were enforced on 23 January [17] .

Thailand implemented measures for screening patients travelling from Wuhan since 3 January 2020 at Suvarnabhumi Airport, Don Mueang, Phuket and Chiang Mai airports, and stepped up surveillance at public and private hospitals"
819,"The two cases described here who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were the first confirmed exported cases from China, suggesting early international spread"
820,"Therefore, while one cannot exclude the possibility that asymptomatic cases in their incubation period would be missed and become infectious later, screening of incoming travellers from an affected area proved successful at least in these two instances, when COVID-19 cases were detected, isolated, observed and only discharged once they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2"
821,"Thereafter, this disease was named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO), and the causative virus was designated as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [6] "
822,"The coronavirus isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients with unidentified pneumonia in Wuhan is a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to genus β, and subgenus sarbe [5] "
823,SARS-CoV-2 is different from the zoonotic MERSr-CoV and SARSr-CoV and becomes the seventh coronavirus to infect humans [5] 
824,"The phylogenetic analysis of the coronaviruses based on full-length genome sequences shows that SARS-CoV-2 has the smallest genetic distance from bat coronavirus, but only about 45%-90% similarity with SARSr-CoV, and a lower similarity of 20%-60% with MERSr-CoV [18] "
825,"Therefore, a bat is probably the original host of SARS-CoV-2, although the intermediate host may still exist in the process of transmission from bats to human beings.

Coronavirus has an envelope, the particles are round or oval, often pleomorphic, with a diameter of 50-200 nm [18] "
826,"also reported that SARS-CoV-2 S-protein supports a strong interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecules, which means that the virus poses a significant public health risk for human transmission by the S-protein-ACE2 binding pathway [18] .

The knowledge of the physical and chemical characteristics of coronaviruses mostly comes from the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV"

The recent outbreak of the unknown severe pneumonia in China is caused by a novel coronavirus named 2019-nCoV [2] , later was designated SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses"
830,"Compared with SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 results in much lower mortality in patients but has a comparable infection ability"
831,"All patients in our databases had a laboratory confirmed SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Our COVID-19 database was made publicly available as a Google Sheet, disseminated via Twitter on Jan 21, 2020, and posted on the website of Northeastern University, (Boston, MA, USA) on Jan 24, 2020, where it is updated in real time"
832,"A relatively short time period of gain is likely due to high contingency of the SARS-CoV-2, and also that the substantial fraction of infected individuals with milder symptoms are likely to escape the border control"
833,"On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, and WHO reported that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020, was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January [1] "
834,"Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model, and R 0 was calculated based on the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2.

The reported cases of SARS-CoV-2, which have been named as COVID-19, were collected for the modelling study from a published literature [3] "
835,c) The SARS-CoV-2 in reservoir (the seafood market) was denoted as W
836,"We assumed that the retail purchases rate of the hosts in the market was a, and that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the purchases was I H /N H , therefore, the rate of the SARS-CoV-2 in W imported form the hosts was aWI H /N H where N H was the total number of hosts"
837,"We also assumed that the transmissibility of A P was κ times that of I P , where 0 ≤ κ ≤ 1.

The parameters of the BHRP model were shown in Table 1 .

We assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 might be imported to the seafood market in a short time"
838,"b) Based on our previous studies on simulating importation [13, 14] , we set the initial value of W as following impulse function:

In the function, n, t 0 and t i refer to imported volume of the SARS-CoV-2 to the market, start time of the simulation, and the interval of the importation.

Therefore, the BHRP model was simplified as RP model and is shown as follows:

During the outbreak period, the natural birth rate and death rate in the population was in a relative low level"
839,"The normalized RP model is changed as follows:

The transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 based on the RP model

In this study, we used the R 0 to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2"
840,"h) Since the SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, we assumed that it could be died in the environment in a short time, but it could be stay for a longer time (10 days) in the unknown hosts in the market"
841,"Based on the equations of RP model, we can get the disease free equilibrium point as: In the matrix:

By the next generation matrix approach, we can get the next generation matrix and R 0 for the RP model: 

The R 0 of the normalized RP model is shown as follows:

Our modelling results showed that the normalized RP model fitted well to the reported SARS-CoV-2 cases data (R 2 = 0.512, P < 0.001) (Fig"
842,"The value of R 0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person, and from person to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58.

In this study, we developed RP transmission model, which considering the routes from reservoir to person and from person to person of SARS-CoV-2 respectively"
843,The simulation results showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.58 from person to person
844,There was a research showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47-2.86) [8] 
845,Another research showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.9) [3] 
846,Our results also showed that the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.30 from reservoir to person which was lower than that of person to person
847,"Therefore, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be higher than MERS in the Middle East countries, similar to SARS, but lower than MERS transmitted in the Republic of Korea.

To contain the transmission of the virus, it is important to decrease R 0 "
848,"Firstly, we did not use the detailed data of the SARS-CoV-2 to perform the estimation instead of using the data from literatures [3] "
849,"Therefore, the accuracy and the validity of the estimation would be better if the models fit the first-hand data on the population mobility and the data on the natural history, the epidemiological characteristics, and the transmission mechanism of the virus.

By calculating the published data, our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be higher than MERS in the Middle East countries, similar to SARS, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea"
850,"Since the objective of this study was to provide a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the R 0 was estimated based on limited data which published in a literature"
851,"This virus, named ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), can cause a severe and even fatal respiratory disease, called Coronavirus disease-19 , and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)"
852,"SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the large family of Coronaviridae (""BetacoronavirusṼ iralZone,"" n.d.)"
853,"The SARS-CoV-2 genome has now been sequenced: its close similarity to SARS suggests that it has emerged from the same reservoir, namely bats .

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) is the main molecule present at the surface of the virion"
854,"The angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is a known cell receptor for SARS in human and bats, and is also used by SARS-CoV-2 "
855,"We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may also use integrins as cell receptors in one or more host species, binding to them through a conserved RGD (403-405: Arg-Gly-Asp) motif that is present in the receptor-binding domain of the spike proteins of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences analyzed to date (Fig"

865,"This virus is the closest to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of organ tropism and symptoms, although it mainly affects children"
866,"Interestingly, the metapneumovirus protein F's RGD motif adopts a fold similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, with a small loop inserted between two secondary structures (in this case two β-sheets) (Cox et al., 2012) "
867,"Given these apparent similarities, it is plausible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired integrin-binding to promote virus entry into host cells, but experimental proof of this is required"
868,"Alternatively, the virus could infect different target cells by binding to ACE2 or to integrins.

There are currently few antiviral molecules that are effective against SARS-CoV-2 Agents that block integrin binding may provide a promising avenue of research"
869,"However, as a variety of animal species were for sale in the market when the disease was first reported, further studies are needed to determine the natural reservoir and any intermediate hosts of WHCV.

870,"The coronavirus was subsequently found to be a relative of SARS and named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [7, 8] .

While examination of the viral genome was critical for identifying the pathogen, information made publicly available in real time describing clinical characteristics and other outbreak-related factors also allowed experts to consider the etiology and thereby differential diagnoses"

874,"As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (now named SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease COVID-19) has caused over 75,000 confirmed cases inside of China and has spread to 25 other countries (World Health Organization, 2020b) "
875,"Here we use a mathematical model to analyse the expected performance of different screening measures for , based on what is currently known about its natural history and epidemiology and on different possible combinations of departure and arrival screening policies.

First we assess the probability that any single individual infected with SARS-CoV-2 would be detected by screening, as a function of time since exposure"
876,"Even among passengers of repatriation flights, or quarantined on a cruise ship off the coast of Japan (who are all demonstrably at high risk), numerous cases have been undetectable in symptom screening, but have still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR Hoehl et al., 2020; Japan Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; "
877,"If such tests were fast, there may be potential to test suspected cases in real time based on questionnaire responses, travel origin, or borderline symptoms; at least one PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 claimed to take less than an hour has already been announced (Biomeme, 2020) "
878,"Most importantly, strict regulations against the domestication and consumption of wildlife should be implemented.

Thus, prior to 2018, bats collected in some areas of China have been shown to carry CoVs capable of directly infecting humans.

A recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 has 96% homology at the whole genome level with bat coronavirus"
887,"In phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 not only share a common ancestor, but also have an amino acid identity of 82.3% [27] [28] [29] .

Viruses often require intermediate hosts before transmitting from bats to humans"
888,Pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in Guangxi and Guangdong of southern China were detected with multiple CoV linages with 85.5-92.4% genome sequence similarity to those of SARS-CoV-2 [36] 
889,"However, the only source of bats that have been publicly identified as carrying virus phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV-2 is far away from Wuhan in Zhoushan, Zhejiang"
890,"It is also necessary to find a mechanism for the very quick outbreak in such a wide area by a natural source of SARS-CoV-2.

Epidemiological investigations showed that 13 of the first 41 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 had nothing to do with Huanan Seafood Market [45] "
891,"Therefore, there is a possibility that SARS-CoV-2 spread from Zhoushan to Wuhan due to bat migration.

It turned out that bats are not only attracted by green lights but also red lights [54] "
892,"Amazingly, most of the SARS-2 patients can be traced to a single unique etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2"
893,"How could this likely single source of virus quickly infect so many people in such large geographic area? This is a question that is difficult to answer now, but must be answered in future.

Although the origins and the occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 are both unclear, the control measures for the current epidemic should focus on immediate cut-off of transmission of the disease and through disinfection of infected locations"
894,Areas that will be open to the public should be carefully surveilled for the existence of SARS-CoV-2 and be cleaned of the virus if it is found
895,"As a matter of fact, if fine-tuned and highly-effective internet control for ""public opinions"" can be turned into beneficial use of monitoring the ""epidemic situation"", fighting against an even larger outbreak of any infection would be much easier and cost-effective.

SARS-CoV-2 has entered human communities, and eliminating virus from human bodies does not means its eradication in nature"
896,The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection will remain for a long time
897,"Worldwide collaborative efforts from scientists are underway to understand the novel and rapidly spreading virus that causes this disease, SARS-CoV-2 (originally tentatively named 2019-nCoV), and to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing it [6] [7] [8] [9] .

Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae"
898,"While no case of SARS-CoV infection has been reported since 2004, MERS-CoV has been around since 2012 and has caused multiple sporadic outbreaks in different countries.

Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus [12] "
899,"With SARS-CoV-2 being discovered very recently, there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus (e.g., information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or T cell responses)"
900,"Preliminary studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis [9, 12] , and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage [9, 13, 14] "
901,"Due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.

Various reports related to SARS-CoV suggest a protective role of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses"
902,"Further, of the structural proteins, T cell responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting [27] .

Here, by analyzing available experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes (both linear and discontinuous) and T cell epitopes, we identify and report those that are completely identical and comprise no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020)"
903,"These epitopes have the potential, therefore, to elicit a cross-reactive/effective response against SARS-CoV-2"
904,"Our presented results can potentially narrow down the search for potent targets for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and help guide experimental studies focused on vaccine development.

A total of 120 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded on 21 February 2020 from the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/CoV2020/) (Table S1 )"
905,"These nucleotide sequences were aligned to the GenBank reference sequence (accession ID: NC_045512.2) and then translated into amino acid residues according to the coding sequence positions provided along the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (orf1a, orf1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, and ORF10)"
906,"We stopped when no increase in the accumulated population coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated with any of the remaining MHC alleles.

We used the publicly available software PASTA v1.6.4 [31] to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of each structural protein using the unique set of sequences in the available data of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2"
907,"Each constructed tree was rooted with the outgroup Zaria Bat coronavirus strain, and circular phylogram layout was used.

All sequence and immunological data, and all scripts (written in R) for reproducing the results are available online [33] .

SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be close to SARS-CoV-much more so than MERS-CoV-based on full-length genome phylogenetic analysis [9, 12] "
908,"A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) ( Figure 1a )"
909,"The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins ( Figure 1a ); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b) "
910,"It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004"
911,"Percentage sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 All trees were constructed based on the available unique sequences using PASTA [31] and rooted with the outgroup Zaria Bat CoV strain (accession ID: HQ166910.1).

Given the close genetic similarity between the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we attempted to leverage immunological studies of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV to potentially aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2"
912,We used the available SARS-CoV-derived experimentally-determined epitope data (see Materials and Methods) and searched to identify T cell and B cell epitopes that were identical-and hence potentially cross-reactive-across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
913,We aligned these T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences
914,"Among the 115 T cell epitopes that were determined by positive T cell assays (Table 1) , we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within SARS-CoV-2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020) ( Table 2) "
915,"Nonetheless, they also present promising candidates for inducing a response against SARS-CoV-2"
916,"For the expanded set of epitopes, all of which have at least one positive MHC binding assay, we found that 229 epitope-sequences have an identical match in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and have associated MHC allele information available (listed in Table S2 )"
917,"Our aim was to determine sets of epitopes associated with MHC alleles with maximum population coverage, potentially aiding the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2"
918,"Thus, while the ordering of T cell epitopes in Table 3 is based on the estimated global population coverage of the associated MHC alleles, it is also a natural order in which these epitopes should be tested experimentally for determining their potential to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2"
919,Set of the SARS-CoV-derived spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein T cell epitopes (obtained from positive MHC binding assays) that are identical in SARS-CoV-2 and that maximize estimated population coverage globally (87 distinct epitopes)

We aligned the 298 linear B cell epitopes (Table 1) across the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that 49 epitope-sequences, all derived from structural proteins, have an identical match and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (as of 21 February 2020)"

Mapping the residues of the linear and discontinuous B cell epitopes onto the available structure of the SARS-CoV S protein revealed their distinct association with the two functional subunits of the S protein [42] : S1, important for interaction with the host cell receptor, and S2, involved in fusion of the cellular and virus membranes (Figure 2a) "
926,"Thus, the antibodies targeting the identified linear epitopes in the S2 subunit might cross-react and neutralize both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as suggested in a very recent study [43] .

While S2 is comparatively less exposed than S1, it may be accessible to antibodies during the complex conformational changes involved in viral entry of coronaviruses [44] [45] [46] ; though this remains to be more clearly understood"
927,"We observed that very few residues of the 3 discontinuous epitopes were identical within SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2c, right panel) "
928,"These differences suggest that the SARS-CoV-specific antibodies S230, m396, and 80R known to bind to these epitopes in SARS-CoV might not be able to bind to the same regions in SARS-CoV-2 S protein"
929,Further studies are currently under way to identify other SARS-CoV antibodies that may bind to discontinuous epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [48]

935,"Both the side view (left panel) and the top view (right panel) of the structure are shown.

The quest for a vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as an urgent problem"
936,"At this early stage, there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, which presents a challenge for vaccine development.

This study has sought to assist with the initial phase of vaccine development by providing recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in vaccine designs"
937,"Despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to SARS-CoV-2, these epitopes are motivated by responses they have recorded in SARS-CoV (or, for the case of T cell epitopes, to at least confer MHC binding), and the fact that they map identically to SARS-CoV-2, based on the available sequence data (as of 21 February 2020)"
938,"Despite the apparent similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there is still considerable genetic variation between the two, and it is not obvious a-prior if epitopes that elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV are likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2"
939,"We found that only 23% and 16% of known SARS-CoV T cell and B cell epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, respectively, and with no mutation having been observed in these epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020)"
940,"This provides a strong indication of their potential for eliciting a robust T cell or antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.

On the T cell side, the identification of SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that map identically to SARS-CoV-2, and the large population that these are expected to cover, is particularly encouraging"
941,"On the B cell side, in agreement with very recent experimental studies [47, 48] , our results suggest that SARS-CoV-derived antibodies targeting the receptor binding motif in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may not be effective, due to the large genetic mismatches observed in known structural epitopes targeting this domain"
942,"Numerous of these epitopes, while being less exposed, are found to map identically to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and preliminary results are already emerging which suggest their potential in generating cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies [43] "
943,"Hence, vaccine solutions that attempt to induce antibodies that target the S2 linear epitopes may be effective and should be explored further.

Research efforts directed towards the design and development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are increasing, and some related analyses are already being reported in distinct, parallel studies"
944,"While only a summary of the results has been provided so far, preventing direct comparison of the individual epitopes, the number of linear B cell epitopes reported to map identically to SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to our findings.

A recent study has also predicted T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 that may be presented by a population from the Asia-Pacific region [55] "
945,"Second, computational tools were used to predict MHC Class II epitopes in [55] , while here we analyzed the SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that have been determined experimentally, using either positive T cell or MHC binding assays, and which match identically with the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020)"
946,"Thus, our identified epitopes are seemingly a more rational set of potential targets that can assist in the ongoing search for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

We acknowledge that this is a preliminary analysis based on the limited sequence data available for SARS-CoV-2 (as of 21 February 2020)"
947,"If mutations do occur within epitope regions, then these epitopes may be further screened in line with the conservative filtering principle that we have employed, thereby producing a more refined epitope set.

Further experimental studies (T cell and B cell assays) are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2"
948,"This would help to further refine the reported epitope set, based on observed immunogenicity; an important consideration for immunogen design.

Overall, as the identified set of SARS-CoV epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, they present potentially useful candidates for guiding experimental efforts towards developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2"
949,"More generally, our study further highlights the potential importance of previous experimental and clinical studies of SARS-CoV, and its use in concert with emerging data for SARS-CoV-2, in searching for effective vaccines to combat the COVID-19 epidemic.

As the number of COVID-19 patients in China has been growing rapidly, preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the most important and urgent task [57] "

974,"26th, 2020, the China CDC started to develop a new vaccine for SARS-CoV-2"
975,"Suspected infections can be detected accurately and quickly for timely isolation and treatment to avoid infecting others by using these test reagents.

Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are CoVs; hence, the treatment strategies of SARS could be relevant for COVID-19 [74] "

980,"The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is more than 85% similar to the genome of the SARS-like virus ZC45 (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1), and together these types of viruses form a unique Orthocoronavirinae subfamily with another SARS-like virus ZXC21 in the sarbecovirus subgenus [35] "
981,"Human SARS-CoV and a genetically similar bat coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZXC21, MG772934) from southwest of China have formed another clade within the sarbecovirus [35] .

We also performed comparative genomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by zpicture"
982,"The results showed that the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have extremely high homology at the nucleotide level (Figure 4a,b) "
983,"There are six regions of difference (RD) in the genome sequence between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the RDs are named according to the order of discovery"
984,"These RDs may provide new molecular markers for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and also help to develop new drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

To analyze the homogeneity of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, an evolutionary tree was constructed based on the genomes of 35 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different data submission units, one SARS-CoV strain, and two MERS-CoV strains ( Figure S1 )"

To further explore whether all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to that of SARS-CoV, we performed a protein sequence alignment analysis using Blastp"
988,"The results showed that most of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are highly homologous (95%-100%) to the proteins of SARS-CoV virus, indicating the evolutionary similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2) "
989,"However, two proteins (orf8 and orf10) in SARS-CoV-2 have no homologous proteins in SARS-CoV"
990,The amino acid sequence of orf8 in SARS-CoV-2 is different from sequences of conserved orf8 or orf8b derived from human SARS-CoV [11] 
991,Orf8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 does not contain known functional domain or motif
992,"Therefore, it will be clinically meaningful to analyze the biological function of these two specific proteins (orf8 and orf10) in SARS-CoV-2"
993,"The N protein in SARS-CoV-2 shares~90% amino acid identity with that in SARS-CoV [28] , which indicates that antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV would likely recognize and bind the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well"
994,"N antibodies do not provide immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the antibodies have a cross reactivity with SARS-CoV N protein viruses, which would allow a serum-based assay to identify the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected-cases [28] "
995,"Although previous studies have found serum reactivity to group SARS-CoV N proteins in Chinese populations [92] , exposure to SARS-CoV-2 should increase the dilution factor if the infection had occurred"
996,"This information has important implications for preventing the spread of asymptomatic infections.

In addition, spike stalk S2 in SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45) and human SARS-CoV [11] "
997,demonstrated that the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was capable of binding ACE2 in the context of the SARS-CoV spike protein [51] 
998,"Among SRAS-CoV spike protein's fourteen residues predicted to interact directly with human ACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV, eight amino acids are well conserved in homology SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [26, 102] "
999,"showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors to infect humans, bats, civets, monkeys, and swine, but not mice [106] "
1000,"Compared to previously reported SARS-CoV strains, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors more efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2003), but less efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2002) [106] "
1001,"The mutation of proteins determines two important characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2: A higher ability to infect and enhanced pathogenicity than the bat-like SARS-CoV, but a lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV [43] .

As a large number of people have left Wuhan, the control of the epidemic situation is extremely urgent, and the treatments of COVID-19 are imminent"
1002,"In addition, the potential adaptive mutation of SARS-CoV-2 makes it difficult for vaccine development"
1003,The latest one is SARS-CoV-2
1004,It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shared almost 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV [11] 
1005,Our results also showed that almost all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to SARS-CoV proteins ( Table 2) 
1006,The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 also shows some similarities to that of MERS-CoV
1007,"It will be very interesting to study the relationship among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 that may be exploited for future developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.

Although more and more studies for SARS-CoV-2 have sprung up since the outbreak of this epidemic COVID-19, based on our comparison, we propose some key questions to be clarified in future studies (Table 3 )"
1008,In-depth understanding the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 will reveal more targets for better therapy of COVID-19
1009,"Proposed questions to study SARS-CoV-2 for future studies.

What is the effect of the surface epitope and receptor binding domain of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 on the virus' infectivity?

Is there any effect of SARS-CoV vaccine designed according to S protein on SARS-CoV-2?

Does SARS-CoV-2 orf8 and orf10 proteins, which have no homology proteins in SARS-CoV, play roles in the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2?

Can the susceptibility of asymptomatic carriers be judged by detecting the serum reactivity level of N protein?

Apart from droplet transmission and contact transmission, are there other methods to transmit SARS-CoV-2?

What is the percentage of COVID-19 patients have been infected with SARS and produced antibodies?

Is there an effective specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 solution?

Does traditional Chinese medicine have any effect on the treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2?

Do ethnic differences affect the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2?

Do any environmental factors, such as regional conditions or climate, affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission?

1011,"Chinese health authorities have taken prompt public health measures, including intensive surveillance, epidemiological investigations, and closure of the market on 1 January, 2020 ( Figure 1 ).

On 9 January, 2020, the Chinese Government reported that the cause of the outbreak was a novel coronavirus, recently named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) [2], and was responsible for a disease defined COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease 2019)"
1012,"SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a β-Coronavirus of group 2B with at least 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV-1, but sufficiently divergent to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus (Table 1 ) [4] "
1013,"It is highly probable that genome differences between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 could be responsible for the different functionality and pathogenesis; thus, further studies could significantly help to solve this gap"
1014,"The genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 has been shared on 10 January, 2020, in order to allow the production of specific diagnostic PCR tests in different countries for detecting the novel infection [5] .

The evident convergence between SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus (at least 96% identical at the wholegenome level) seems to suggest that bats could be the original host [6] "
1015,"A possible role of civets, snakes, and pangolins is not excluded as potential intermediate hosts, and it is clear that tracking the path of the virus could be crucial for preventing further exposure and outbreaks in the future.

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences have been found to have limited variability and the estimated mutation rates in coronavirus, which SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetically links to, are moderate to high, compared to the others in the category of single-stranded RNA viruses [7] "
1016,"However, an accurate measure of the mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2 has not been calculated and the evaluation of its genetic evolution over time could have important implications for strategic planning in the prevention, as well as in the development of vaccines and antibodies-based therapies.

Another important key point is the role of humoral immunity that, as for other coronavirus, might not be strong or long-lasting enough to keep patients safe from contracting the disease again.

After infection occurred, incubation has been estimated to vary from 5 to 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days [8]"
1017,"Moreover, there are evidences that SARS-CoV-2 appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of patients in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific, whereas the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with a high viral load in the sputum of convalescent patients arouse concern about prolonged shedding of the virus after recovery [10] .

In symptomatic COVID-19 patients, illness may evolve over the course of a week or longer, beginning with mild symptoms that progress (in some cases) to the point of dyspnea and shock [11] "
1018,"Moreover, fatality rates seem to be decreasing over time (15.6%, 1-10 January, 2020; 5.7%, 11-20 January, 2020; 1.9%, 21-31 January, 2020; 0.8% after 1 February, 2020) although this finding could be due to the increasing detection of ""mild"" cases in the general population or to a better management of the disease [14] .

Unfortunately, to date, there are no vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, and there is the awareness that several months may be required to undergo extensive testing, and determine vaccine safety and efficacy before a potential wide use"
1019,"However, many doubts about the new coronavirus remain, whereas there is the conviction that finding and sharing answers to these questions could represent a major challenge for public health control of a possible global SARS-CoV-2 outbreak"
1020,"Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population likely occurred in mid-November 2019 [16] .

Virus phylogenesis SARS-CoV-2 is genetically very close to SARS-CoV, but sufficiently divergent to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus [4] .

Genome differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could be responsible for the different functionality and pathogenesis.

Virus hosts SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical at the wholegenome level to a bat coronavirus [4] .

Cat civets, snakes, and pangolins are indicated as potential intermediate hosts.

Tracking the path of the virus could be crucial for preventing further exposure and outbreaks in the future.

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences have limited variability and the estimated mutation rates in coronavirus, which SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetically links to, are moderate to high compared to the others in the category of ssRNA viruses [7] "
1021,"How SARS-CoV-2 evolves over time could have important implications for both strategic planning in public health interventions, prevention of, and development of vaccines and antibodies.

On inanimate surfaces, human coronaviruses can remain infectious for up to 9 days"
1022,"A surface disinfection with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 62%-71% ethanol can be regarded as effective against coronaviruses within 1 min [15, 17] .

Virus spreading to human SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person-to-person via respiratory droplets (coughs or sneezes) and possibly also via contaminated hands or surfaces"
1023,The detection of SARS-CoV-2 and a high sputum viral load in a convalescent patient arouse concern about prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 after recovery [10] 
1024,"There are evidences that SARS-CoV-2 appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of a patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific [10] .

The fact that asymptomatic persons are potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection may warrant a reassessment of transmission dynamics of the current outbreak.

In symptomatic patients, illness may evolve over the course of a week or longer, beginning with mild symptoms that progress (in some cases) to the point of dyspnea and shock [11] "
1025,"Face masks do not seem to be as effective in protecting those who are not infected, and wearing a mask could be useful only when taking care of a person with suspected COVID-19 [20] .

There are currently no vaccines against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

Various vaccine strategies against coronavirus, such as using inactivated viruses, live-attenuated viruses, viral vectorbased vaccines, subunit vaccines, and recombinant proteins are under evaluation"
1026,"However, several months may be required to undergo extensive testing to determine its safety and efficacy and before it can be widely used [21] .

Because of the current uncertainties about the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to easily spread from human to human, the decision to consider a contact as close if the case-contact distance was between 1 m and 2 m was made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the type and length of interaction"
1041,"However, should the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occur during the asymptomatic phase, we cannot exclude that secondary transmission events initiated from the three confirmed cases remained undetected during the investigations.

Case 3 developed symptoms 4 days after her husband and 5 days after the couple had left Wuhan"
1042,"The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is currently estimated at around 3-7 days [5, 10, 11] "
1043,"The data available on 12 February strongly suggest that human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is frequent, with the reproduction number estimated at 2 to 3 [5, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] "
1044,"Twenty-five countries have already reported imported cases from China, and several of them have described autochthonous transmission events [15] .

In the case of further spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, it would soon become impossible to detect all imported cases and trace their contacts"
1045,"Given the first estimations of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period, the probability of secondary cases originating from those three cases is negligible.

1046,"In outbreaks involving newly emerged viruses, the situation may be different, and appropriate procedures to deal with these viruses need to be established or refined with high priority.

Here, we present an assessment of the genetic relatedness of the newly identified human coronavirus 3 , provisionally named 2019-nCoV, to known coronaviruses, and detail the basis for (re)naming this virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which will be used hereafter"

1048,Distance estimates between SARS-CoV-2 and the most closely related coronaviruses vary among different studies depending on the choice of measure (nucleotide or amino acid) and genome region
1049,"Accordingly, there is no agreement yet on the exact taxonomic position of SARS-CoV-2 within the subgenus Sarbecovirus"
1050,"When we included SARS-CoV-2 in the dataset used for the most recent update (May 2019) of the coronavirus taxonomy currently being considered by ICTV 19 , which includes 2,505 coronaviruses,

The terms strain and isolate are commonly used to refer to virus variants, although there are different opinions as to which term should be used in a specific context"
1051,"the species composition was not affected and the virus was assigned to the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, as detailed in Box 4.

With respect to novelty, SARS-CoV-2 differs from the two other zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, introduced to humans earlier in the twenty-first century"
1052,The situation with SARS-CoV-2 is fundamentally different because this virus is assigned to an existing species that contains hundreds of known viruses predominantly isolated from humans and diverse bats
1053,The CSG chose the name SARS-CoV-2 based on the established practice for naming viruses in this species and the relatively distant relationship of this virus to the prototype SARS-CoV in a species tree and the distance space ( Fig
1054,"2b  and the figure in Box 4) .

The available yet limited epidemiological and clinical data for SARS-CoV-2 suggest that the disease spectrum and transmission efficiency of this virus 31-35 differ from those reported for SARS-CoV 9 "
1055,"To accommodate the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 (ranging from asymptomatic to severe or even fatal in some cases) 31 , the WHO recently introduced a rather unspecific name (coronavirus disease 19, also known as COVID-19 (ref"

1074,"Qualified reads were mapped to NC_045512, a SARS-CoV-2 genome reference using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (v0.7.12-r1039), and a bam file was produced"
1075,"These mutations may occur by cell culture-adaptation in that our culture isolate was obtained after first blind passage, or by micro-evolution of SARS-CoV-2 before acquisition in Wuhan"
1076,"As a result, it was confirmed that our isolate is a beta-CoV belonging to the subgenus sarbecovirus, and that it closely clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Korea and Wuhan.

In summary, we isolated SARS-CoV-2 using Vero cells from the first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patient in Korea"

1081,"Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the same subgroup of beta coronaviruses, the similarity at the genome level is only 70%, meaning that the new virus is genetically different from SARS-CoV [ Figure 1A , http://links.lww.com/CM9/A209].

Rapid discovery of the causative agent and development of diagnostic reagents demonstrated that technology has greatly improved in the 17 years since the SARS outbreak"
1082,"The incidence among medical staff in the respiratory care department of a university affiliated hospital in Guangzhou was 61.7%

(29/47), i.e., more than half of the medical staff were infected while treating their patients.

As for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the first patient with unexplained pneumonia was identified on December 12, 2019"
1083,"In contrast to that of SARS-CoV, the discovery of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 came relatively late.

On Dec 29, 2019, an obvious human-to-human transmission case was identified"
1084,"Five days later, clusters of cases, including 15 healthcare workers, were confirmed to have been infected via patients, confirming that SARS-CoV-2 also has human-to-human transmission capability [ Figure 1E ]"
1085,"Based on these results, it was concluded that SARS-CoV-2 also has high human-to-human transmission capability"
1086,"The close contacts of these unidentified patients might act as new infection sources and could become superspreaders.

The incidence and development process of the SARS outbreak has valuable implications for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak"
1087,"The spring festival travel period in 2020 started from Jan 10 to Feb 18, which coincided with the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases between Jan 10 and 22, 2020 [ Figure 1F , red box]"
1088,"The daily counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases were higher than the daily counts of SARS cases during its peak in 2003, implying a possibly higher number of cumulative cases"
1089,"Since SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to SARS-CoV, some important characteristics of SARS-CoV could be used for this prediction"
1090,"By combining the reported daily counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases and data from the SARS outbreak, we constructed a logistic model and predicted the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over time"
1091,"With this data and the present situation, we predict that the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases might be 60,000-70,000"
1092,"Logistic models were fitted to these data, and the cumulative and daily counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases were predicted"
1093,"Setting the upper limit of cumulative incidence (K) to 50,000, 60,000, or 70,000, the end date of incidences will be in 56 days (Mar 6, 2020), 60 days (Mar 10, 2020), or 62 days (Mar 12, 2020), respectively.

Using valuable epidemiological data from the SARS outbreak, we systematically evaluated and compared the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV outbreaks.

The two outbreaks share many similarities, and the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak situation seems to be a repetition of the SARS-CoV outbreak situation"
1094,"However, due to the lack of awareness regarding the human-to-human transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages, there is a possibility that superspreaders exist"
1095,"These concerns have proven prescient with the emergence, late in 2019, of the 2019 coronavirus disease or novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV), in Wuhan, China.

A significantly large variety of coronavirus species cause a diverse range of diseases in domesticated and wild mammals and birds, and these animals may also be carriers of and reservoirs for coronaviruses [2] "
1096,"SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus species that is now known to infect humans, is also zoonotic in origin, and is the causative organism for the current viral pneumonia epidemic in China.

Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are believed to have originated from bats, with common masked civets and dromedary camels respectively being intermediary hosts [ 3] .

SARS-like coronaviruses have been isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats, and may attach to and utilize the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in human lower respiratory tract cells to gain entry into these cells, thus facilitating transmission to, and initiating infection in, humans [4] "
1097,"The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is strikingly similar to that of SARS-like coronaviruses found in bats, and phylogenetic data from recent genomic studies on bat-associated coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that bats are the natural reservoir for coronaviruses in general, and SARS-CoV-2 in particular [5] "
1098,"It has been postulated that the reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 is the Chinese horseshoe bat, which is known to host SARS-like coronaviruses"
1099,"It is currently estimated that the R。for SARS-CoV-2 is between 2.2 and 2.7 [6, 7] "
1100,Human super spreaders for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified thus far in limited epidemiological studies conducted in the past six weeks of the outbreak [6] 
1101,"However, clinicians and researchers should be acutely aware of the likelihood for the potential existence of such transmitters of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population, and of the means to identify and isolate such individuals expeditiously in order to prevent a reduction of the current epidemic doubling time of approximately 7 days, and to limit viral transmission and spread [7] "
1102,"Ominously, a further mathematical model, proposed by Tang et al, [9] suggests that the basic reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 might be as high as 6.47"
1103,"Each preventable zoonotic outbreak costs the country of origin and the world vast amounts of money and resources, and an inestimable cost in human lives, and if emerging zoonotic outbreaks can be prevented by severely limiting human exposure to wild animals and their trade, then effective measures to ensure that this occurs should be implemented by regulatory government authorities globally as soon as it is practicable.

It is clearly apparent that the work done thus far in the quest to contain the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is massive, focused and resolute"
1104,"It is fervently hoped that the steadfast efforts by China, in partnership with the international community, will reap positive results with respect to SARS-CoV-2 control in the future weeks and months"
1105,"Additionally, urgent international attention to and curtailment of the hitherto unregulated and commonplace trade in wild game, meat and products is essential if a repeat of the human and economic loss, and public fear and social disruption wreaked by the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is to be avoided in the future"
1106,I would like to suggest that the virus be named human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19) instead of SARS-CoV-2
1107,"He is also the Director of the Christophe Merieux Laboratory.

An ICTV (The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) work group suggested to name the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was temporarily referred to by WHO as ""2019 novel coronavirus"" (2019-nCoV) "
1108,"To avoid conceptual confusion and considerable public fear associated with SARS, the new coronavirus should not be named SARS-CoV-2.

On the basis of the historical nomenclature procedure, I suggest to establish a standardized nomenclature process for coronaviruses"
1109,"Based on genotyping, SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be significantly linked to SARS-CoV"
1110,"Rather, SARS-CoV-2 may lead to the misunderstanding of the pathogenesis of the new coronavirus, which is less pathogenic compared with SARS-CoV.

Human coronavirus (HCoV) is commonly referred to coronaviruses of low pathogenicity, with human beings being their primary natural host, as exemplified by HCoV-OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1"

1124,"The WHO have announced that the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 is referred to as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) [15] .

Despite recent efforts in basic and translational influenza and coronavirus research, there is still no vaccine against coronaviruses for use in humans (this includes SARS and MERS) [16] [17] [18] [19] "
1125,"Genetic evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is genetically related to two bat coronaviruses [7, 28] "
1126,"Contrary to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 cases have been reported to a quite large extent outside the epicentre of the infection"
1127,"The numbers of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 continued to grow since its emergence till January 31 (figure 1), and as of the date of this publication, the virus has caused more than 74,000 confirmed and reported infections in humans globally [11, 29] "
1128,"Through rapid and frequent international air travel, infections due to SARS-CoV-2 have spread to over 26 countries around the world causing more than 2,000 deaths including four deaths outside China in the Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and France have been reported as of 19 February, 2020 [9, 29] .

The epidemiological data available at the time of this publication are summarized in figure 2 [10] "
1129,Infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are yet unreported at the time of this publication in South American countries
1130,"Globally, the clinical picture in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have ranged from mild (no or few signs and symptoms), to severe, including death"
1131,It will also help determine whether SARS-CoV-2 circulated in Wuhan before December 2019 and will help track the origin of this outbreak among Chinese populations and humans in other parts of the world who had travel history to the epicentre prior to the known start of the outbreak
1132,"It was previously reported that the sensitive and specific serological detection of MERS-CoV in subclinical infection is challenging [34, 35] .

SARS-CoV-2 can cause asymptomatic to fatal respiratory diseases [36] "
1133,Evaluation of the serologic response of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients according to the disease severity will help determine the potential role of serodiagnostic parameters as prognostic markers
1134,"The development of accurate and robust serological assay will help determine the accurate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.

Infections due to SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed [37] , however further investigations are required to determine and understand the full extent of this mode of transmission"
1135,"So far, there is no evidence of airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, however precautionary measures are recommended due to the lack of information excluding this mode of transmission"
1136,"SARS-CoV-2

transmission in humans appears efficient and the virus is of pandemic potential"
1137,"Subsequently, the US declared it a public health emergency on January 31, 2020 [39] , and several travel restrictions to the epicentre of the outbreak were imposed by the USA, Canada, UK, many countries in Europe, the Philippines, several other countries have followed similar travel restriction [40, 41] to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection importation by air travel.

COVID-19 is a recent example of the complex threats of emerging infectious diseases"
1138,"The implementation and development of One Health collaborations on a global scale are critical to reduce the threats of emerging viruses [42, 43] .

Regarding SARS-CoV-2 in particular, there are several aspects that needs a One Health approach in order to understand the outbreak, and to mitigate further outbreaks of a similar virus"
1139,"SARS-CoV-2 is likely a bat-origin coronavirus that was transmitted to humans through a spill over from bats or through an undetermined yet intermediate animal host (avian, swine, phocine, bovine, canine, other species) or wild animals"
1140,"Figure 3 depicts a transmission hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, yet the intermediate host is to be determined"
1141,There are no data available in scientific literature on the detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from environmental samples
1142,"However, it was recently reported that the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isolated SARS-CoV-2 from 33 samples out of 585 environmental samples collected from Huanan Seafood Market [47] "
1143,"Also, this means that the most viable solution may not be to close down live animal markets but perhaps to 'sector' them so that fewer different species mingle in one specific market and that the specific intermediate host(s) for SARS-CoV-2 may be removed from the markets, or rigorously tested for the virus.

iii) Decreasing the human-to-human transmission"
1144,"This review does not aspire to cover the large subject of human-to-human transmission control, but also here a mixture of measures is important from strictly medical (transmission routes, efficiency of PPE, vaccines, antivirals and so on) to more social science-oriented (How do people behave when they suspect they could be infected? How do they behave when they are sick? How to potentially change these behaviours?).

To successfully decrease the risk for a new SARS-CoV-2 outbreak or an outbreak of a similar virus, a One Health approach is crucial.

In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19 is continuing to cause global fears, psychological distress, economic losses and negative impacts on several human activities including industry and mobility"
1145,"To date, SARS-CoV-2 does not represent a pandemic threat with the same severity as e.g"
1146,"[1] [2] [3] [4] In addition, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has renamed the virus, which was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on phylogeny, taxonomy, and established practice"
1147,"Increased dissemination of information through use of the internet is associated with increased transmission of information from all geographical regions and 4 across disciplines regarding recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 6 ; nevertheless, important factors associated with COVID-19, specifically age and sex distribution, incubation period, clinical features, and optimal treatment, remain uncertain"
1148,"Therefore, herein, we performed a literature review, focusing on the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease (ARD), and pneumonia.

COVID-19 was defined as the respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in China in 2019

(https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid- 19) .

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are protean, which include asymptomatic carrier, ARD, and pneumonia of varying degrees of severity"
1149,"8 Further, Wei et al.

reported that nine infants under 1 year of age were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in China"
1150,"18 In addition to family cluster infections due to human-to-human transmission, 19 nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious concern"
1151,"In addition, pneumonia cases presented a higher white blood cell count and neutrophil count, but had a reduced leukocyte count compared to ARD cases.

Serum procalcitonin levels of ≥0.5 ng/mL were found in 6.1% (6/99), 12 7.7%

(3/39), 13 to 13.7% (16/117), 11 among SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients reported from three studies"
1152,"Initial studies reported that the mortality rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranged from 11% 12 to 15%, 13 but later studies revealed that the mortality rate was between 1.4% 11 and 4.3%"
1153,"8 Together, these findings suggest that old age and increased disease severity could predict a poor outcome.

In this stage of lack of effective drugs, the implementation of infection control interventions and traffic control bundle to effectively limit droplet, contact, and fomite transmission is the only way to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2"
1154,"47, 48 Uncertain issues

Although information on COVID-19 has increased rapidly since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, many issues remain unresolved"
1155,"First, the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 ranges from the asymptomatic carrier 19 state to severe pneumonia; however, most early reports only showed the findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in which the ratio of male patients was much larger than that of female patients, there were no pediatric cases, and the mortality rate was high"
1156,"8, 11 However, whether children were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, or their presentation was mostly asymptomatic or difficult to detect, remains unclear"
1157,More studies are needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 and to identify the risk and prognostic factors of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2
1158,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), first isolated in Wuhan China, has already caused more infections than the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002 and 2003"
1159,"For each assembled genomic sequence, the tool identifies the virus species, constructs a phylogenetic tree and identifies phylogenetic clusters, which includes the novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan China in 2019 (SARS-CoV-2)"
1160,"To this reference dataset, we added 47 whole genomes of the current Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019"

"
1167,"Of these, 16 were cases imported into the country (57.1%) and 10 were believed to be secondary cases of infections originating in Korea; in the other 2 cases, the route of transmission remained undetermined.

The initial symptoms of COVID-19 are known to be respiratory symptoms such as coughing, in association with fevers, but the disease epidemiology remains largely unknown.

To treat new infections and prevent further transmission, it is necessary to analyze and share epidemiological data on the cases reported to date [2] .

This is a case series of the 28 patients with confirmed However, between January 20 th and January 28 th , 4 patients who presented with symptoms outside of the Hubei province who had visited Wuhan, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and the number of cases outside Wuhan continued to increase.

On January 28 th , other areas in China where the infection was reported, were also quarantined"
1168,The first confirmed pediatric case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in Shenzhen on January 20
1169,The data from Hubei province was incomplete because children were rarely screened for SARS-CoV-2 initially
1170,"1B , during the emerging stage of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the infection was disseminated by person-to-person transmission in the community almost exclusively among adults"
1171,"A chest CT showed a ground glass opacity at lingulate lobe of left lung, and his throat swab was also positive for SARS-CoV-2"
1172,Nasal and throat swabs taken on January 19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2
1173,Follow-up testing for SARS-CoV-2 on January 24 (day 5) and January 28 (day 9) were still positive but turned negative on January 31 (day 12) and February 1 (day 13)
1174,"The child's mother, who did not go to Wuhan but came to hospital to take of him was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasal and throat swabs"
1175,He was then tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by a throat swab test
1176,"Another 30-h-old neonate, born to an infected mother, initially presented with respiratory distress without fever, and later was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, according to a news report by China News Service.

If the disease went further extension without being efficiently contained, the outbreak might go into an explosion stage, when the school transmission mixed with a wider community spread could occur (Fig"
1177,Children at that stage can further become the main spreader of SARS-CoV-2 because their infection is usually mild
1178,"T lymphocyte subsets showed a decrease in both CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cell subsets, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an early and reliable indicator for the development of severe COVID-19, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can consume lymphocytes, which may also be an important reason for the virus to proliferate and spread in the early stage of the disease"
1179,"13 In children, however, white blood cell count and absolute lymphocyte count were mostly normal, and no lymphocyte depletion occurred, suggesting less immune dysfunction after the SARS-CoV-2 infection"
1180,"Further studies to unveil why sick children have a milder form of disease may help to the future development of immunotherapy and vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2.

"
1181,"Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) [8, 9] "
1182,"A history of travel to China in the 14 days prior to symptom onset.

A close physical contact in the past 14 days with a confirmed case of COVID-19 infection.

As it relates to KSA and with the ongoing MERS-CoV community cases and hospital acquired infections, there will be a huge challenge for health care workers (HCWs) to combat both viruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2"
1183,"Those patients can present with broad range of signs and symptoms and should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the already wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14 days should be ignored.

The new COVID-19 guidance document [12] produced by Saudi CDC provides HCFs with a new visual triage (VT) for ARI that has a checklist for placing patients in isolation precautions with score ≥6, with the weight of the points to history of travel to China in the last 14 days prior to symptoms onset, which is given five points"
1184,"This is a true concern with the already rapid international spread to 25 countries outside China, especially with the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread from a totally asymptomatic person [15] .

Since the declaration of PHEIC by WHO on January 31, 2020 [16] , 16 cities in mainland China with a population of around 60 million people remain under quarantine [17] "
1185,SARS-CoV-2 has been sequenced [3] 
1186,"A phylogenetic analysis [3, 4] found a bat origin for the SARS-CoV-2"
1187,"There is a diversity of possible intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, including pangolins, but not mice and rats [5] .

There are many similarities of SARS-CoV-2 with the original SARS-CoV"
1188,[6] found that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have almost identical 3-D structures in the receptor-binding domain that maintains van der Waals forces
1189,"SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins share 76.5% identity in amino acid sequences [6] and, importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins have a high degree of homology [6, 7] .

Wan et al"
1190,"[4] reported that residue 394 (glutamine) in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), corresponding to residue 479 in SARS-CoV, can be recognized by the critical lysine 31 on the human ACE2 receptor [8] "
1191,Further analysis even suggested that SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human ACE2 more efficiently than SARS-CoV increasing the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to transmit from person to person [4] 
1192,"Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted to also have a strong binding affinity to human ACE2.

This similarity with SARS-CoV is critical because ACE2 is a functional SARS-CoV receptor in vitro [9] and in vivo [10] "
1193,"[13] demonstrated that overexpressing ACE2 from different species in HeLa cells with human ACE2, pig ACE2, civet ACE2 (but not mouse ACE2) allowed SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, thereby directly showing that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor"
1194,They further demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 does not use other coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [13] 
1195,"In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly binds with the host cell surface ACE2 receptor facilitating virus entry and replication.

A key question is why the lung appears to be the most vulnerable target organ"
1196,"We therefore predict that the intestine might also be a major entry site for SARS-CoV-2 and that the infection might have been initiated by eating food from the Wuhan market, the putative site of the outbreak"
1197,Whether SARS-CoV-2 can indeed infect the human gut epithelium has important implications for fecal-oral transmission and containment of viral spread
1198,"1) .

Development of a spike1 subunit protein-based vaccine may rely on the fact that ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor"
1199,"[25] recently demonstrated that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry and viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor [26, 27] "
1200,"The serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, approved in Japan to treat unrelated diseases, has been shown to block TMPRSS2 activity [28, 29] and is thus an interesting candidate.

The interaction sites between ACE2 and SARS-CoV have been identified at the atomic level and from studies to date should also hold true for interactions between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2"
1201,"This suggests that excessive ACE2 may competitively bind with SARS-CoV-2 not only to neutralize the virus but also rescue cellular ACE2 activity which negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to protect the lung from injury [12, 30] "

Potential approaches to address ACE2-mediated COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection"
1203,The finding that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the ACE2 receptor for cell entry has important implications for understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and pathogenesis
1204,"SARS-CoV and likely SARS-CoV-2 lead to downregulation of the ACE2 receptor, but not ACE, through binding of the spike protein with ACE2"
1205,Potential therapeutic approaches include a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-based vaccine; a transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor to block the priming of the spike protein; blocking the surface ACE2 receptor by using anti-ACE2 antibody or peptides; and a soluble form of ACE2 which should slow viral entry into cells through competitively binding with SARS-CoV-2 and hence decrease viral spread as well as protecting the lung from injury through its unique enzymatic function
1206,"SARS, similar to SARS-CoV-2, originated in the Republic of China with evidence that while it most likely originated in bats, entered the human population through intermediate hosts, most likely the 'Himalayan palm civet' (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) [8] "
1207,"On January 7th 2002, Chinese authorities announced the detection of a novel human betacoronavirus, provisionally named 2019-nCoV by the WHO (and later renamed, SARS-CoV-2) as the agent responsible for the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan"
1208,"The on-going outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has already caused far more infections than SARS or MERS and in a far shorter time, most likely because a significant percent of patients do not become seriously ill in a time-frame that would rapidly lead to their detection"
1209,"Based on the current numbers for COVID-19 (death rate of 2-3 per 100) the new coronavirus appears less deadly than SARS (mortality~1 in 10) or MERS (mortality~3/10), but more deadly than seasonal flu (mortality~0.5 to 1 per 1000).

While SARS-CoV-2 is spreading at alarming rates in China, there has not yet been sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China"
1210,"Recent evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as its entry point; data that should speed the development of an effective drug and eventually a safe and effective vaccine.

One Health approaches attempt to strategize the coordinated efforts of multiple overlapping disciplines [19] , including environmental surveillance and environmental health"
1211,"At the time of writing, the host from which the SARS-CoV-2 entered the human population is unknown although the suspicion is that food markets are likely sources for the original spillover"
1212,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged from China with a total of 14,557 laboratory-confirmed cases (as of February 2, 2020) [1] "
1213,"In addition, in France a healthcare worker was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory disease who treated two patients later identified as probable cases [3] "
1214,"A similar effect can be expected against the SARS-CoV-2.

None.

"
1215,"Although the patient denied spending time at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and reported no known contact with ill people during her stay in Wuhan, specimens including oropharyngeal swab and sputum were collected for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) in accordance with the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) guidance.

Apart from a history of hypothyroidism with regular medical follow-up, she had no other underlying disease before this onset"
1216,"On January 21, 2020, the TCDC confirmed that the patient's oropharyngeal swab and sputum tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR assay.

The results of serial chest X-rays performed on illness day 10 (hospital day 1), 13, 17, and 25 coincided with the changes in SPO2 and revealed slowing remission of worsening patches infiltrating at first (Fig"
1217,"Other cultures showed non-significance.

On illness day 17, her sputum turned undetectable for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR assay"
1218,"2, 4 These findings suggested that lower respiratory tract seems to be an important location for the replication of SARS-CoV-2"
1219,"The quarantine period for potentially COVID-19 infected individuals was challenging by our case's laboratory results, her sputum specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on day 15 and turned negative on day 17 of illness.

Similar to viral pneumonia due to other etiologies, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) are the main CT findings of the patients with COVID-19"
1220,"Given the negative rRT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 on illness day 21 and 23, there were persistent milder bilateral lung opacities on the chest radiograph on illness day 25 (Fig"
