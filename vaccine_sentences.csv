0,"COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.

There is a close genetic relatedness between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2"
1,"Whereas positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract has been described 9 , these observations do not address principal differences between SARS and COVID-19 in terms of clinical pathology"
2,"In cases when this initial diagnostic testing was done by other laboratories, the original samples were retrieved and re-tested under the rigorous quality standards of the present study.

To first understand whether the described clinical presentations are solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, samples from all patients were tested against a panel of typical agents of respiratory viral infection, including HCoV-HKU1, -OC43, -NL63, -229E; Influenza virus A and B, Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Human Parainfluenza virus 1-4, Human metapneumovirus, Adenovirus, and Human bocavirus"
3,"Together, these data indicate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the throat during the first 5 days after symptoms onset"
4,"The two patients who showed some signs of pneumonia were the only cases where sputum viral loads showed a late and high peak around day 10/11, whereas sputum viral loads were on the decline by this time in all other patients (Figure 2 F,G) .

Seroconversion was detected by IgG and IgM immunofluorescence using cells expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a virus neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 ( Table   3 )"
5,"At the same time, the concurrent use of ACE-2 as a receptor by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to a highly similar excretion kinetic in sputum, with active replication in the lung"
6,"Whereas proof of replication by histopathology is awaited, extended tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 with replication in the throat is strongly supported by our studies of sgRNAtranscribing cells in throat swab samples, particularly during the first 5 days of symptoms.

Striking additional evidence for independent replication in the throat is provided by sequence findings in one patient who consistently showed a distinct virus in her throat as opposed to the lung"
7,"Critically, the majority of patients in the present study seemed to be already beyond One of the most interesting hypotheses to explain a potential extension of tropism to the throat is the presence of a polybasic furin-type cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is not present in SARS-CoV 17 "
8,"Replication in the gastrointestinal tract is also supported by analogy with SARS-CoV, which was regularly excreted in stool, from which it could be isolated in cell culture 23 .

Our failure to isolate live SARS-CoV-2 from stool may be due to the mild courses of cases, with only one case showing intermittent diarrhea"
9,Further studies should therefore address whether SARS-CoV-2 shed in stool is rendered non-infectious though contact with the gut environment
10,"This assay used cloned CoV spike protein from HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and SARS-CoV-2"
11,"A/H1N1pdm09 has subsequently transitioned into a seasonal pattern causing winter epidemics in temperate climates.

Here we use data on seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs in Sweden and model the impact of this variation on the possible future spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere"
12,"We also explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread in temperate and tropical regions and show how variation in epidemiological parameters affects a potential pandemic and the possibility of transitioning to an endemic state.

Data on seasonal variation of HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E diagnoses in respiratory samples was obtained from the routine molecular diagnostics at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"
13,"The strength of variation of the transmission rate through the year could be of high relevance to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and following years.

We consider simple SIR models (Kermack and McKendrick, 1991) with an additional category E of exposed individuals of the form

where β(t) is the rate at which an infected individual infects a susceptible one, µ is the inverse incubation time, ν is the recovery rate and b is the population turn-over rate.

Depending on the analysis below, we implement several such populations that exchange individuals through migration, for details see Supplementary Methods"
14,"The qualitative behavior of the fit is robust to uncertainty in R 0 and the frequency of reinfection b.

The analysis of seasonal CoV prevalence patterns allowed us to constrain parameter ranges and explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the globe, in particular in temperate climates like Northern Europe.

Here we explore scenarios where temperate regions have a seasonal forcing of between ε = 0.3 and 0.7 and migration rates of 0.01/year"
15,3 shows simulated trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the temperate Northern Hemisphere assuming the outbreak started in Hubei early December 2019
16,"Depending whether the peak transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in the northern temperate zone is in November, January, or March, the simulation predicts a main peak in the first half of 2020, a main peak in winter 2020/2021, or two similarly sized peaks.

To explore possible scenarios more systematically, we ran such simulations for a range of values for R 0 and peak transmissibility θ and recorded whether we observe and early peak, a late peak, or a two peaks"
17,"We have witnessed such rapid dispersal to SARS-CoV-2 to many countries across the globe during January and February 2020.

Every location has a different socio-economic profile such that the growth rate of the epidemic (and hence R 0 ) might differ"
18,"7 .

After several years, SARS-CoV-2 could become a seasonal CoV with characteristic winter outbreaks as shown in Fig"
19,"4 is run for 12 years, with the added assumption that after infection an individual become susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 again at a rate of 0.1 per year as we assumed for seasonal CoV above"
20,"After a pronounced low in 2020-2024, prevalence recovers and settles into a seasonal pattern, similar to that of the four existing seasonal CoVs.

We report on the possible influence of seasonal variation on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Northern Hemisphere, in a pandemic scenario"
21,We find that seasonal variation in transmissibility has the potential to modulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a wide range of possible outcomes that need to be taken into account when interpreting case counts and projecting the outbreak dynamics
22,"The onset of spring and summer could, for example, give the impression that SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully contained, only for infections to increase again in 2020-2021 winter season"
23,"/2020 If previously infected individuals can be reinfected after some time, as for example by seasonal influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 could develop into a seasonal CoV that returns every winter"
24,"The results we present are critically dependent on the assumptions i) that the outbreak will develop into a pandemic, ii) that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonal variability of sufficient strength (range ε = 0.3 to 0.7), and iii) that parameters like R 0 estimated from the early phase of the outbreak are comparable in other populations"
25,"These assumptions are not implausible but not certain: cases of SARS-CoV-2 has been in several countries in Asia apart from China, as well as in Europe, Africa, North America, and Australia (WHO Emergency Committee, 2020b), and mild or asymptomatic cases make detection and thus prevention of spread by isolation challenging, e.g"
26,"It should be noted, however, that SARS-CoV-2 does seem to transmit in tropical climates like Singapore, and so winter is not a necessary condition of SARS-CoV-2 spread"
27,(2020) showing that recent trends in different regions across East-Asia imply that seasonality alone is unlikely to end SARS-CoV-2 spread
28,"The implications of our work are that: 1) reductions in prevalence need not be attributable to successful interventions, but could be due to seasonal variation in transmissibility, 2) sub-population dynamics can differ greatly, meaning that case count trajectories in one country should be used cautiously to inform projections in a second country, even in the same climate zone, 3) seasonal variation might slow down a pandemic and thereby provide a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems world-wide by scaling up capacity for care and diagnostics, and potentially through rapid development of antivirals and vaccine, and 4) after several years SARS-CoV-2 could develop into an endemic seasonal CoV similar to the transition of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic influenza virus into a seasonal influenza virus.

The overall impact of a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic depends critically on the case fatality ratio (CFR), which we have not modelled here"
29,"Even with this unknown, seasonal variation in transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and underlying differences in migration, introduction times, and attack rate should thus be taken into account when monitoring and projecting global transmission, planning further surveillance of the epidemic, and developing pandemic prevention and containment strategies.

30,"On February 11, 2020, WHO Director-General announced that the novel coronavirus was officially named ""SARS-CoV-2"" On February 7, 2020, the Chinese Health and Health Commission temporarily named novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia as novel coronavirus pneumonia, abbreviated as""NCP"" [4] "
31,Background Whether the patients with COVID-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute renal function damage is a problem worthy of clinical attention
32,"This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.

Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020"
33,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR.

Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease"
34,"In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19"
35,"Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF.

In December 2019, an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is now officially named as ""2019 coronavirus disease "" by the WHO [1] [2] [3] "
36,"Whole genome sequencing and systematic analysis showed that this novel coronavirus is a distinct clade from beta coronavirus associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [6] , which was officially named ""SARS-CoV-2"" by WHO now"
37,"Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated, current evidence suggests it was transmitted to humans through the spread of wild animals illegally sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [7] "
38,Case reports have confirmed the interpersonal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [8] 
39,"reported in 138 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed cases, presumed hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3% [10] "
40,"In this study, the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed, and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function were explored.

Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is located in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, an area where COVID-19 is endemic"
41,"This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.

All COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were laboratory-confirmed cases, which were identified with nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a throat swab samples using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)"
42,The criteria for the confirmed-diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was that at least one gene site was amplified to be positive for nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1ab gene
43,19.20025288 doi: medRxiv preprint was used for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics were recorded"
45,"Data from above two studies suggested that acute renal impairment was uncommon in COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious azotemia and acute renal injury.

Based on the clinical, pathologic study, and laboratory features of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients in 2003, the data showed that acute renal impairment was uncommon, but carried a formidably high mortality (91.7%, 33 of 36 cases) [17] "
46,Be cause high homology of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
47,"In this study, we also observed that the patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and confirmed as COVID-19"
48,"Unlike a formidably high mortality in SARS complicated with renal impairment, none of the patients died from the aggravation of CRF or from COVID-19 itself caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2"
49,Rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 itself provides utility in two main areas
50,"First, specific amplicon-based sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 allows for potential contact tracing, molecular epidemiology and studies of viral evolution"
51,"This is particularly important for SARS-CoV-2 as the virus could undergo recombination with other human coronaviruses and mutation and this may also affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy.

To identify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 two complementary techniques were used.

First, an amplicon-based system and the second, a metagenomic approach, that can also be used to assess the background microbiome"
53,"For the amplicon-based system, a series of primers were designed such that the SARS-CoV-2 genome could be amplified in appropriately 1000 base paired sequential fragments, with an approximately 200 base pair overlap to allow sequence assembly from the amplicon data (Fig"
54,The primers were selected on the basis of conserved regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome based upon an initial deposition of 17 genomes
55,"To test whether the primers could generate amplicons, RNA was purified from Vero cells that had been infected with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (MT007544.1 GenBank)"

The prominent sequence differences between the crucial RBMs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV raise a critical question of whether the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is comparable to that of SARS-CoV"
85,"A recent study by computational modeling suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a lower binding affinity to human ACE2, as a result of the loss of one hydrogen bond interactions 18 "
86,"9 measured the SARS-CoV-2 RBD's binding affinity to human ACE2 protein to be 15.2 nM, which is comparable to previously published affinity data for SARS-CoV spike protein 19 "

Neutralizing antibody (nAb) is expected to be one of the most promising treatments against coronavirus infection among the existing therapeutic options 20, 21 "
88,"However, coronavirus is a single-stranded RNA virus prone to rapid mutations during transmission, nAbs without cross-reactivity to a broad spectrum of viral mutants could lead to treatment failure 10, [27] [28] [29] , therefore, highly potent and cross-protective nAbs and prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are in urgent needs.

105,Two SARS-CoV S-protein rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Table 1 ) and four monoclonal antibodies ( Table 2 ) were analyzed for cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 PSV
106,"As expected, the polyclonal antibodies showed weaker binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (EC 50 >100ng/mL) as compared to SARS-CoV S1 protein (EC 50 <25ng/mL)"
107,"Neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV were lower by more than two-orders of magnitudes than SARS-CoV PSV (Table 1) , presenting a pessimistic forecast for the probability to identify highly potent and cross-reactive nAbs to SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV antibodies or antibody libraries.

SARS-CoV monoclonal nAbs with strong S1 binding (EC 50 <50ng/mL, K D ≤2.0E-10 M) and potent ACE2-blocking activities exhibited potent neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV (minimum dose to reach 100% neutralization at ~0.1μg/mL), but almost no cross-binding to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (EC 50 >15μg/mL) and no cross-neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV (<50% neutralizing activity at 100μg/mL) (Figure3, Table 2, Figure S1 & S2).

Interestingly, three ACE2-non-blocking monoclonal antibodies showed modest binding activities to SARS-CoV S1 protein (EC 50 >100ng/mL) and neutralizing activities to the SARS-CoV PSV (minimum dose to reach 100% neutralization at ≥ 10 μg/mL)"

Taking the two viruses' RBD structure similarities and glycosylation sites into account, we predict that there are two possible conserved regions in RBD where epitopes for cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies reside"
114,"Note that N 357 ST in SARS-CoV is changed to N 370 SA in SARS-CoV-2, which is different from the NXS/T pattern required for glycosylation, and hence this site is more likely to be unglycosylated"
115,"Hence, understanding the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and their implications may offer significant scientific and practical value.

Though it is difficult to assess the virus-host-cell interactions with real virion, we studied the new SARS-CoV-2 in head-to-head comparisons with SARS-CoV using multiple methods"
116,"Measurements of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins to recombinant ACE2 protein and ACE2 expressing 293T cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to human ACE2 (Figure 2A&B) , which provided direct molecular based evidences to support and possibly explain the observation that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has similar transmissibility to SARS-CoV virus.

Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are both coronaviruses with over 70% sequence homology and share the same human receptor ACE2, analyzing SARS-CoV's antibodies' cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 may provide useful information on whether neutralizing epitopes were conserved on the two coronaviruses"
117,Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies produced with SARS-CoV S1 and RBD proteins had potent binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV but only modest cross-binding and cross-neutralizing activities to the new SARS-CoV-2 virus
118,"However, virtually no cross-binding or cross neutralizing activities against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus were detected with the four ACE2 blocking monoclonal antibodies.

We then screened non-ACE2-blocking antibodies raised from SARS-CoV RBD for neutralizing activities"
119,"Although, binding affinities to SARS-CoV S1 protein was significantly lower with EC 50 between 55 to 224 μg/mL as compared to 16 to 42 μg/mL EC 50 for the four ACE2-blocking nAbs, significant cross-binding activities to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and modest cross-neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 PSV were detected.

The observation that these three antibodies bind to and neutralize both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 without blocking ACE2 suggest the following"
120,"Hence it is possible but maybe challenging to identify antibodies with potent neutralizing activities to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and ideally to their mutant virus strains as well"
121,"We analyzed 68 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants in GISAID and found 4 variants with mutations in RBD (one has N354D/D364Y, two have V367F, and one has F342L)"
122,"In a recent article 9 , a SARS-CoV RBD neutralizing antibody CR3022 with an epitope outside the RBM motif was also shown to be non-blocking but cross-binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a relatively low K D of 6.3 nM.

The neutralization mechanism of these non-blocking antibodies is not clear yet"
123,"Whether these non-blocking RBD antibodies also interfere with S2 protein's configuration change remains to be investigated.

In summary, the above findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to human ACE2 with similar affinities and hence may have similar transmissibility"

131,"The current epidemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a rising global health emergency (WHO https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) with disruptive health, social and economic repercussions"
132,"The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data are a pivotal resource on its own, but can gain greater value when embedded within those of other Betacoronavirus, allowing a comparative pangenomic analysis"
133,This approach can help identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2
134,"Whereas core genomic features are required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence"
135,"Furthermore, we provide insights into importance, key features and differences in the Envelope protein, E, conserved separately in SARS, MERS and coronaviruses from other animals.

We used a pangenome approach to explore the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN985325 and related isolates) in comparison to other Betacornaviruses, including SARS and MERS"
136,"The resulting pangenome including all core and accessory gene clusters, interactive trees and alignments from 24 Betacoronavirus genomes, including 4 isolates from SARS-CoV-2, is available at https://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/.

There are five essential genes in coronaviruses, the Spike protein (S), Membrane glycoprotein (M), Nucleocapsid (N), envelope protein (E) and the Orf1ab (a large polyprotein known as replicase/protease), all required to produce a structurally complete viral particle 13 "
137,"One of these E clusters comprises only SARS-CoV-1 (AY274119), SARS-CoV-2 and two Bat Coronaviruses (MG772933 and KF63652)"
138,"To validate the conservation and specificity of the SARS E cluster, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 E sequence with all known sequences in NCBI's non redundant (NR) protein database"
139,"This comparison showed, consistent with our pan-genome analysis, that the subcluster of the protein E gene appearing in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and two bat coronaviruses, is defined by the same essential functional features, which are exactly conserved (100% similarity) between bats and SARS-CoV-2, but differ slightly (95% similarity with one deletion and three substitutions) from SARS ( Figure 2B and supplementary figure 7) "
140,"A recent study compared genomes and gene families of all alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses, but did not explore the variability present within the protein E gene sequences, which we did through the clustering approach reported above.

We found five accessory gene clusters (15% of the accessory genome of genus Betacoronavirus) common to SARS-like coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, out of 33 total accessory gene clusters"
141,"1A ), appear only in SARS-CoV-2, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and the SARS virus"
142,A gene cluster annotated as ORF10 appeared to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig
143,"Our bioinformatic protein structural analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a (cluster 12), also known as viroporin, and ORF7a (cluster 17), that is same as ORF8a 14 in SARS, retain the structural features observed in other SARS viruses, namely a multi-pass transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic b-barrel or b-sandwich fold (ORF3a) and an N-terminal secpathway signal peptide, cleaved after residue 15, an immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich fold stabilized by two cysteine di-sulfide bonds, and a C-terminal single-pass transmembrane helix (ORF7a; Supplementary Figures 5,6 )"
144,"Hence these SARS-CoV-2 proteins are expected to act in the same way as they do in other SARS, namely as accessory proteins mostly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, but also occurring on the cell membrane where they enhance viral pathogenicity and mortality through protein-protein interactions [15] [16] [17] .

The remaining two accessory gene clusters, ORF6, ORF8, present in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and bat-SL-CoVZC45 are functionally uncharacterized"
145,"Collectively, our analysis suggested no major function or gene cluster to be unique to SARS-CoV-2"
146,"The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3 "
147,"Furthermore, the E gene is one of the key genes used in identification of SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR 7,24 .

The SARS-Cov-1 protein E has ion channel (IC) activity and features a postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif (PBM)"
148,"The protein E from SARS-CoV-2 differs from that of SARS-CoV-1 only by three substitutions and one deletion (Figure 2A Studies on SARS-CoV-1 demonstrated that the E protein uses the IC and PBM to trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs"
149,"Ultimately these events result in ARDS 4-6 , a leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7, 8 "
150,"Consequently, inhibition of p38 by SB203580 increases the survival of the host 5 .

The high level of conservation of the IC and PBM within clade 2, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, strongly suggests that the available inhibitors for the E protein of SARS-CoV-1 should also be active on SARS-CoV-2.

Therapies to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the lethality caused by the resulting COVID-2019 are currently focusing primarily on S, the viral spike protein 3,25,26 "
151,"However, despite high similarities between proteins S between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, existing neutralizing antibodies are ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 3 "
152,"Hence, new antibodies that bind specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein need to be developed, tested and approved for human use, which would be a time-consuming process.

Our pangenomic analysis suggests that the protein E of all SARS viruses preserves its critical motifs used for pathogenesis"
153,"Hence, we predict that the readily available and approved inhibitors (Amantadine, Hexamethylene amiloride and SB203580), that proved efficient for alleviating ARDS in SARS-CoV-1-infected animal models should also be effective against SARS-CoV-2"

A short gene predicted in in SARS-CoV-2, known as ORF10, appears unique only to SARS-CoV-2"
157,This raises a question whether ORF10 is an artifact of annotation in SARS-CoV-2 where it has been predicted or an artifact in SARS and SARS-like genomes where it has not been predicted
158,"For completeness purposes we included ORF10 in our functional and structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not included in the main text.

Supplementary Figure 4 -6 shows predicted Gene Ontology and structural information about ORF10 using deep learning Gene Ontology Prediction tool (DeepGOplus)"

164,"In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was confirmed in Wuhan, China, which had spread rapidly through outside of Wuhan and around the world (1, 2) "

167,"Information recorded included demographic data, underlying conditions, symptoms, and laboratory and chest radiograph findings, comorbidities, intubation rates, ventilator settings prior to and during ICU therapy.

169,All patients had positive throat swabs of SARS-CoV-2 and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs ( Figure 1 ) and were admitted to ICUs
170,"Moreover, 11 patients (24.4%) have been recovered and discharged from hospital (table 4).

In order to identify the potential risks for intubation in severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, Chi-square test showed that older (age > 60 years), higher SOFA (> 4), APACHE II (> 15) score and LDH (> 255U/L)and lower lymphocyte (< 0.8*10 9 /L) at ICU admission were at high risks for intubation"

172,"Of all included patients, 37 (82.2%) had developed ARDS, 20 (44.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 9 (20.0%) required ECMO, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe illness.

Our study population might represent most of the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection"
173,"Therefore, lymphocytopenia may reflect the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection"
174,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 led to more than 65,000 infected patients in Wuhan (CCDC report on February 28, 2020)"
175,"Therefore, the mortality was relatively lower in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province.

Our study has several limitations"
176,"However, due to the novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and a relative lack of surveillance data on the existing human coronaviruses, it has not been possible to project how the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will unfold in the coming years, including the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the seasonal coronaviruses.

We used data from the United States to model betacoronavirus transmission in temperate regions and to project the possible dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the year 2025"
177,"According to the best-fit model parameters, the basic reproduction number for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 varies between 1.4 in the summer and 2 in the winter, the duration of immunity for both strains is about 40 weeks, and each strain induces cross-immunity against the other, though the cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 infection induces against HCoV-HKU1 is stronger than the reverse.

Next, we incorporated a third betacoronavirus into the dynamic transmission model to represent SARS-CoV-2"
178,"We assumed that the incubation period and infectious period for SARS-CoV-2 were the same as the best-fit values for the other betacoronaviruses (5.0 and 4.9 days, respectively; see Table S7 ), in agreement with other estimates (23) (24) (25) "
179,"For a representative set of parameter values within these ranges, we measured the annual incidence proxy due to SARS-CoV-2 ( Table 1, Tables S2-3 ) and the annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreak peak size (Tables S4-6) for the five years following the simulated time of establishment"
180,"We summarized the post-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic outbreaks, or virtual elimination"
181,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112 doi: medRxiv preprint infection due to SARS-CoV-2, and autumn establishments and smaller seasonal fluctuations in transmissibility were associated with larger pandemic peak sizes"
182,"Model simulations demonstrated the following few key points:

i) SARS-CoV-2 can proliferate at any time of year"
183,"In all modeled scenarios, SARS-CoV-2 was capable of producing a substantial outbreak regardless of establishment time.

Winter/spring establishments favored longer-lasting outbreaks with shorter peaks (Fig 3A) , while autumn/winter establishments led to more acute outbreaks (Fig 3B) "
184,"The five-year cumulative incidence proxies were comparable for all establishment times ( Table 1) .

ii) If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not permanent, it will likely enter into regular circulation.

Much like pandemic influenza, many scenarios lead to SARS-CoV-2 entering into long-term circulation alongside the other human betacoronaviruses (e.g"
185,"Short-term immunity (on the order of 40 weeks, similar to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) favors the establishment of annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, while longer-term immunity (two years) favors biennial outbreaks if establishment occurs in the winter or spring and sporadic outbreaks if establishment occurs in the summer or autumn.

iii) If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is permanent, the virus could disappear for five or more years after causing a major outbreak"
186,Long-term immunity consistently led to effective elimination of SARS-CoV-2 and lower overall incidence of infection
187,"If SARS-CoV-2 induces cross immunity against HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, the incidence of all betacoronaviruses could decline and even virtually disappear (Fig 3C) "
188,"The virtual elimination of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 would be possible if SARS-CoV-2 induced 70% cross immunity against them, which is the same estimated level of cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 induces against HCoV-HKU1.

could make SARS-CoV-2 appear to die out, only to resurge after a few years"
189,"Even if SARS-CoV-2 immunity only lasts for two years, mild (30%) cross-immunity from HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 could effectively eliminate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for up to three years before a resurgence in 2025, as long as SARS-CoV-2 does not fully die out (Fig 3D) "
190,"The establishment of sustained transmission can be delayed by rapidly detecting and isolating introduced cases (1).

Our observations are consistent with other predictions of how the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak might unfold"
191,"According to a study of geographic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number across China, seasonal variations in absolute humidity will be insufficient to prevent the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (26) "
192,"A modelling study using data from Sweden also found that seasonal establishment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely in the post-pandemic period (10).

Our study was subject to a variety of limitations"
193,"The transmission model is deterministic, so it cannot capture the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 extinction.

Accurately quantifying the probability of SARS-CoV-2 extinction would depend on many factors for which sufficient evidence is currently lacking"
194,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112 doi: medRxiv preprint evidence from SARS, the most closely related coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2"
195,"However, we expect that if post-pandemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 does take hold in temperate regions, there will also be continued transmission in tropical regions seeded by the seasonal outbreaks to the north and south"
196,"With such reseeding, longterm disappearance of any strain becomes less likely (30) , but according to our model the effective reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 remains below 1 during most of each period when that strain disappears, meaning that reseeding would shorten these disappearances only modestly.

Our findings indicate key pieces of information that are still required to know how the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will unfold"
197,"Most crucially, longitudinal serological studies from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 could indicate whether or not immunity wanes, and at what rate"
198,"According to our projections, this rate is the key modulator of the total SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the coming years"
199,"Furthermore, our findings underscore the need to maintain SARS-CoV-2 surveillance even if the outbreak appears to die out after the first pandemic wave, as a resurgence in infection could be possible as late as 2025.

In summary, the total incidence of COVID-19 illness over the next five years will depend critically upon whether or not it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave, which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that SARS-CoV-2 infection imparts"
200,"The intensity and timing of pandemic and post-pandemic outbreaks will depend on the time of year when widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes established and, to a lesser degree, upon the magnitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility and the level of crossimmunity that exists between the betacoronaviruses"
201,"Longitudinal serological studies are urgently required to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and epidemiological surveillance should be maintained in the coming years to anticipate the possibility of resurgence.

Worldwide collaborative efforts from scientists are underway to understand the novel and rapidly spreading virus that causes this disease, SARS-CoV-2 (originally tentatively named 2019-nCoV), and to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing it (Heymann, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Xin Liu & Wang, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .

237,"Due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.

Various reports related to SARS-CoV suggest a protective role of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses"

241,"These nucleotide sequences were aligned to the GenBank reference sequence (accession ID: NC_045512.2) and then translated into amino acid residues according to the coding sequence positions provided along the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (orf1a, orf1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, and ORF10)"
242,"We used the publicly available software PASTA v1.6.4 [28] to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of each structural protein using the unique set of sequences in the available data of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2"
243,"Each constructed tree was rooted with the outgroup Zaria Bat coronavirus strain, and circular phylogram layout was used.

SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be close to SARS-CoV-much more so than MERS-CoV-based on full-length genome phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) "
244,"A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) (Figure 1a )"
245,"The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins ( Figure 1a ); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b) "
246,"It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004.

Given the close genetic similarity between the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we attempted to leverage immunological studies of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV to potentially aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2"
247,We used the available SARS-CoV-derived experimentally-determined epitope data (see Materials and Methods) and searched to identify T cell and B cell epitopes that were identicaland hence potentially cross-reactive-across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
248,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.933226 doi: bioRxiv preprint Mapping the SARS-CoV-derived T cell epitopes that are identical in SARS-CoV-2, and determining those with greatest estimated population coverage"
249,We aligned these T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences
250,"Among the 115 T cell epitopes that were determined by positive T cell assays (Table 1) , we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within SARS-CoV-2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020) ( Table 2) "
251,"MHC binding assays were performed for 19 of these 27 epitopes, and these were reported to be associated with only MHC binding tests to identify the MHC alleles that bind to these 8 epitopes may reveal additional distinct alleles, beyond the five determined so far, that may help to improve population coverage.

To further expand the search and identify potentially effective T cell targets covering a higher percentage of the population, we next additionally considered the set of T cell epitopes that have been experimentally-determined from positive MHC binding assays (Table 1) , but, unlike the previous epitope set, their ability to induce a T cell response against SARS-CoV was not experimentally determined.

Nonetheless, they also present promising candidates for inducing a response against SARS-CoV-2.

For the expanded set of epitopes, all of which have at least one positive MHC binding assay, we found that 264 epitope-sequences have an identical match in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and have associated MHC allele information available (listed in Table S2 )"
252,"These epitopes were classified as: (i) linear B cell epitopes (antigenic peptides), and (ii) discontinuous B cell epitopes (conformational epitopes with resolved structural determinants).

We aligned the 298 linear B cell epitopes (Table 1) across the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that 50 epitope-sequences, all derived from structural proteins, have an identical match and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (as of 9 February 2020)"
253,"Based on the pairwise alignment between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences ( Figure S2 ), we found that none of these mapped identically to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, in contrast to the linear epitopes"
254,"For 3 of these discontinuous B cell epitopes there was a partial mapping, with at least one site having an identical residue at the corresponding site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Table 5) .

Mapping the residues of the B cell epitopes onto the available structure of the SARS-CoV S protein revealed that the linear epitopes (Table 4 ) map to seemingly less-exposed regions, away from the most exposed region, the ""spike head"" (Figure 3a) "
255,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.933226 doi: bioRxiv preprint within the receptor-binding motif are identical within SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3b )
256,"It has been reported recently that SARS-CoV-2 is able to bind to the same receptor as SARS-CoV (ACE2) for cell entry, despite having multiple amino acid differences with SARS-CoV's receptor-binding motif (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko & Munster, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) "
257,"Whether the antibodies specific to this motif maintain their binding and elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 warrants further experimental investigation.

The quest for a vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as an urgent problem"
258,"At this early stage, there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, which presents a challenge for vaccine development.

This study has sought to assist with the initial phase of vaccine development, by providing recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in subunit vaccine designs"
259,"Despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to SARS-CoV-2, these epitopes are motivated by their responses that they have recorded in SARS-CoV (or, for the case of T cell epitopes, to at least confer MHC binding), and the fact that they map identically to SARS-CoV-2, based on the available sequence data (as of 9 February 2020)"
260,"The identical map between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of any mutation in the identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), suggests their potential for eliciting a robust T cell or antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.

Research efforts directed towards the design and development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are increasing, and some related analyses are already being reported in distinct, parallel studies"
261,"While only a summary of the results has been provided so far, preventing direct comparison of the individual epitopes, the number of linear B cell epitopes reported to map identically to SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to our findings.

A recent study has also predicted T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 that may be presented by a population from the Asia-Pacific region (Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020) "
262,"Second, computational tools were used to predict MHC Class II epitopes in (Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020) , while here we analysed the SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that have been determined experimentally, using either positive T cell or MHC binding assays, and which match identically with the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020).

We acknowledge that this is a preliminary analysis based on the limited sequence data available for SARS-CoV-2 (as of 9 February 2020)"
263,"If mutations do occur within epitope regions, then these epitopes may be further screened in line with the conservative filtering principle that we have employed, thereby producing a more refined epitope set.

Further experimental studies (T cell and B cell assays) are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2"
264,"Overall, as the identified set of epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, they present potentially useful candidates for guiding experimental efforts towards developing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

All sequence and immunological data, and all scripts for reproducing the results are available at https://github.com/faraz107/2019-nCoV-T-Cell-Vaccine-Candidates"

284,"When the template is RNA, the amplification reaction can be occurred in one step by adding reverse transcriptase, and called RT-LAMP.

Magnesium pyrophosphate is produced as a by-product during DNA amplification.

Because the amplification efficiency of LAMP is higher than that of RT-PCR, a large amount of magnesium pyrophosphate causes the reaction solution to become cloudy.

Besides, the added dye calcein can change the mixed solution from orange to green, so the results can not only be observed by a turbidimeter, but also by the naked eye.

Because RT-LAMP is convenient and fast, it shows significant advantages in SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinic (14) "

467,"While no case of SARS-CoV infection has been reported since 2004, MERS-CoV has been around since 2012 and has caused multiple sporadic outbreaks in different countries.

Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus [12] "
468,"With SARS-CoV-2 being discovered very recently, there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus (e.g., information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or T cell responses)"
469,"Preliminary studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis [9, 12] , and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage [9, 13, 14] "
470,"Due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.

Various reports related to SARS-CoV suggest a protective role of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses"
471,"Further, of the structural proteins, T cell responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting [27] .

Here, by analyzing available experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes (both linear and discontinuous) and T cell epitopes, we identify and report those that are completely identical and comprise no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020)"
472,"These epitopes have the potential, therefore, to elicit a cross-reactive/effective response against SARS-CoV-2"
473,"Our presented results can potentially narrow down the search for potent targets for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and help guide experimental studies focused on vaccine development.

A total of 120 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded on 21 February 2020 from the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/CoV2020/) (Table S1 )"
474,"These nucleotide sequences were aligned to the GenBank reference sequence (accession ID: NC_045512.2) and then translated into amino acid residues according to the coding sequence positions provided along the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (orf1a, orf1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, and ORF10)"
475,"We stopped when no increase in the accumulated population coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated with any of the remaining MHC alleles.

We used the publicly available software PASTA v1.6.4 [31] to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of each structural protein using the unique set of sequences in the available data of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2"
476,"Each constructed tree was rooted with the outgroup Zaria Bat coronavirus strain, and circular phylogram layout was used.

All sequence and immunological data, and all scripts (written in R) for reproducing the results are available online [33] .

SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be close to SARS-CoV-much more so than MERS-CoV-based on full-length genome phylogenetic analysis [9, 12] "
477,"A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) ( Figure 1a )"
478,"The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins ( Figure 1a ); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b) "
479,"It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004"
480,"Percentage sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 All trees were constructed based on the available unique sequences using PASTA [31] and rooted with the outgroup Zaria Bat CoV strain (accession ID: HQ166910.1).

Given the close genetic similarity between the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we attempted to leverage immunological studies of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV to potentially aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2"
481,We used the available SARS-CoV-derived experimentally-determined epitope data (see Materials and Methods) and searched to identify T cell and B cell epitopes that were identical-and hence potentially cross-reactive-across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
482,We aligned these T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences
483,"Among the 115 T cell epitopes that were determined by positive T cell assays (Table 1) , we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within SARS-CoV-2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020) ( Table 2) "
484,"Nonetheless, they also present promising candidates for inducing a response against SARS-CoV-2"
485,"For the expanded set of epitopes, all of which have at least one positive MHC binding assay, we found that 229 epitope-sequences have an identical match in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and have associated MHC allele information available (listed in Table S2 )"
486,"Our aim was to determine sets of epitopes associated with MHC alleles with maximum population coverage, potentially aiding the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2"
487,"Thus, while the ordering of T cell epitopes in Table 3 is based on the estimated global population coverage of the associated MHC alleles, it is also a natural order in which these epitopes should be tested experimentally for determining their potential to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2"
488,Set of the SARS-CoV-derived spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein T cell epitopes (obtained from positive MHC binding assays) that are identical in SARS-CoV-2 and that maximize estimated population coverage globally (87 distinct epitopes)
489,"These epitopes were classified as: (i) Linear B cell epitopes (antigenic peptides), and (ii) discontinuous B cell epitopes (conformational epitopes with resolved structural determinants).

We aligned the 298 linear B cell epitopes (Table 1) across the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that 49 epitope-sequences, all derived from structural proteins, have an identical match and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (as of 21 February 2020)"
490,SARS-CoV-derived linear B cell epitopes from S (23; 20 of which are located in subunit S2) and N (22) proteins that are identical in SARS-CoV-2 (45 epitopes in total)
491,"Based on the pairwise alignment between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences ( Figure S3 ), we found that none of these mapped identically to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, in contrast to the linear epitopes"
492,"For 3 of these discontinuous B cell epitopes (corresponding to antibodies S230, m396, and 80R [39] [40] [41] ), there was a partial mapping, with at least one site having an identical residue at the corresponding site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Table 5) "
493,SARS-CoV-derived discontinuous B cell epitopes (and associated known antibodies [39] [40] [41] ) that have at least one site with an identical amino acid to the corresponding site in SARS-CoV-2

Mapping the residues of the linear and discontinuous B cell epitopes onto the available structure of the SARS-CoV S protein revealed their distinct association with the two functional subunits of the S protein [42] : S1, important for interaction with the host cell receptor, and S2, involved in fusion of the cellular and virus membranes (Figure 2a) "
495,"Thus, the antibodies targeting the identified linear epitopes in the S2 subunit might cross-react and neutralize both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as suggested in a very recent study [43] .

While S2 is comparatively less exposed than S1, it may be accessible to antibodies during the complex conformational changes involved in viral entry of coronaviruses [44] [45] [46] ; though this remains to be more clearly understood"
496,"We observed that very few residues of the 3 discontinuous epitopes were identical within SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2c, right panel) "
497,"These differences suggest that the SARS-CoV-specific antibodies S230, m396, and 80R known to bind to these epitopes in SARS-CoV might not be able to bind to the same regions in SARS-CoV-2 S protein"
498,Further studies are currently under way to identify other SARS-CoV antibodies that may bind to discontinuous epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [48] 
499,"The receptor binding motif lies within the S1 subunit and is indicated in orange color.

504,"Both the side view (left panel) and the top view (right panel) of the structure are shown.

The quest for a vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as an urgent problem"
505,"At this early stage, there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, which presents a challenge for vaccine development.

This study has sought to assist with the initial phase of vaccine development by providing recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in vaccine designs"
506,"Despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to SARS-CoV-2, these epitopes are motivated by responses they have recorded in SARS-CoV (or, for the case of T cell epitopes, to at least confer MHC binding), and the fact that they map identically to SARS-CoV-2, based on the available sequence data (as of 21 February 2020)"
507,"Despite the apparent similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there is still considerable genetic variation between the two, and it is not obvious a-prior if epitopes that elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV are likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2"
508,"We found that only 23% and 16% of known SARS-CoV T cell and B cell epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, respectively, and with no mutation having been observed in these epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020)"
509,"This provides a strong indication of their potential for eliciting a robust T cell or antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.

On the T cell side, the identification of SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that map identically to SARS-CoV-2, and the large population that these are expected to cover, is particularly encouraging"
510,"On the B cell side, in agreement with very recent experimental studies [47, 48] , our results suggest that SARS-CoV-derived antibodies targeting the receptor binding motif in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may not be effective, due to the large genetic mismatches observed in known structural epitopes targeting this domain"
511,"Numerous of these epitopes, while being less exposed, are found to map identically to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and preliminary results are already emerging which suggest their potential in generating cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies [43] "
512,"Hence, vaccine solutions that attempt to induce antibodies that target the S2 linear epitopes may be effective and should be explored further.

Research efforts directed towards the design and development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are increasing, and some related analyses are already being reported in distinct, parallel studies"
513,"While only a summary of the results has been provided so far, preventing direct comparison of the individual epitopes, the number of linear B cell epitopes reported to map identically to SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to our findings.

A recent study has also predicted T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 that may be presented by a population from the Asia-Pacific region [55] "
514,"Second, computational tools were used to predict MHC Class II epitopes in [55] , while here we analyzed the SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that have been determined experimentally, using either positive T cell or MHC binding assays, and which match identically with the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020)"
515,"Thus, our identified epitopes are seemingly a more rational set of potential targets that can assist in the ongoing search for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

We acknowledge that this is a preliminary analysis based on the limited sequence data available for SARS-CoV-2 (as of 21 February 2020)"
516,"If mutations do occur within epitope regions, then these epitopes may be further screened in line with the conservative filtering principle that we have employed, thereby producing a more refined epitope set.

Further experimental studies (T cell and B cell assays) are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2"
517,"This would help to further refine the reported epitope set, based on observed immunogenicity; an important consideration for immunogen design.

Overall, as the identified set of SARS-CoV epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, they present potentially useful candidates for guiding experimental efforts towards developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2"
518,"More generally, our study further highlights the potential importance of previous experimental and clinical studies of SARS-CoV, and its use in concert with emerging data for SARS-CoV-2, in searching for effective vaccines to combat the COVID-19 epidemic.

556,"The results showed that most of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are highly homologous (95%-100%) to the proteins of SARS-CoV virus, indicating the evolutionary similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2) "
557,"However, two proteins (orf8 and orf10) in SARS-CoV-2 have no homologous proteins in SARS-CoV"
558,The amino acid sequence of orf8 in SARS-CoV-2 is different from sequences of conserved orf8 or orf8b derived from human SARS-CoV [11] 
559,Orf8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 does not contain known functional domain or motif
560,"Therefore, it will be clinically meaningful to analyze the biological function of these two specific proteins (orf8 and orf10) in SARS-CoV-2"
561,"The N protein in SARS-CoV-2 shares~90% amino acid identity with that in SARS-CoV [28] , which indicates that antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV would likely recognize and bind the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well"
562,"N antibodies do not provide immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the antibodies have a cross reactivity with SARS-CoV N protein viruses, which would allow a serum-based assay to identify the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected-cases [28] "
563,"Although previous studies have found serum reactivity to group SARS-CoV N proteins in Chinese populations [92] , exposure to SARS-CoV-2 should increase the dilution factor if the infection had occurred"
564,"This information has important implications for preventing the spread of asymptomatic infections.

In addition, spike stalk S2 in SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45) and human SARS-CoV [11] "
565,demonstrated that the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was capable of binding ACE2 in the context of the SARS-CoV spike protein [51]

567,"showed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors to infect humans, bats, civets, monkeys, and swine, but not mice [106] "
568,"Compared to previously reported SARS-CoV strains, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors more efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2003), but less efficiently than human SARS-CoV (year 2002) [106] "
569,"The mutation of proteins determines two important characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2: A higher ability to infect and enhanced pathogenicity than the bat-like SARS-CoV, but a lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV [43] .

As a large number of people have left Wuhan, the control of the epidemic situation is extremely urgent, and the treatments of COVID-19 are imminent"
570,"In addition, the potential adaptive mutation of SARS-CoV-2 makes it difficult for vaccine development"
571,The latest one is SARS-CoV-2
572,It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shared almost 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV [11] 
573,Our results also showed that almost all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are homologous to SARS-CoV proteins ( Table 2) 
574,The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 also shows some similarities to that of MERS-CoV
575,"It will be very interesting to study the relationship among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 that may be exploited for future developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.

Although more and more studies for SARS-CoV-2 have sprung up since the outbreak of this epidemic COVID-19, based on our comparison, we propose some key questions to be clarified in future studies (Table 3 )"
576,In-depth understanding the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 will reveal more targets for better therapy of COVID-19
577,"Proposed questions to study SARS-CoV-2 for future studies.

What is the effect of the surface epitope and receptor binding domain of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 on the virus' infectivity?

Is there any effect of SARS-CoV vaccine designed according to S protein on SARS-CoV-2?

Does SARS-CoV-2 orf8 and orf10 proteins, which have no homology proteins in SARS-CoV, play roles in the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2?

Can the susceptibility of asymptomatic carriers be judged by detecting the serum reactivity level of N protein?

Apart from droplet transmission and contact transmission, are there other methods to transmit SARS-CoV-2?

What is the percentage of COVID-19 patients have been infected with SARS and produced antibodies?

Is there an effective specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 solution?

Does traditional Chinese medicine have any effect on the treatment of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2?

Do ethnic differences affect the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2?

Do any environmental factors, such as regional conditions or climate, affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission?

579,"Chinese health authorities have taken prompt public health measures, including intensive surveillance, epidemiological investigations, and closure of the market on 1 January, 2020 ( Figure 1 ).

On 9 January, 2020, the Chinese Government reported that the cause of the outbreak was a novel coronavirus, recently named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) [2], and was responsible for a disease defined COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease 2019)"
580,"SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a β-Coronavirus of group 2B with at least 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV-1, but sufficiently divergent to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus (Table 1 ) [4] "
581,"It is highly probable that genome differences between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 could be responsible for the different functionality and pathogenesis; thus, further studies could significantly help to solve this gap"

583,"A possible role of civets, snakes, and pangolins is not excluded as potential intermediate hosts, and it is clear that tracking the path of the virus could be crucial for preventing further exposure and outbreaks in the future.

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences have been found to have limited variability and the estimated mutation rates in coronavirus, which SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetically links to, are moderate to high, compared to the others in the category of single-stranded RNA viruses [7] "
584,"However, an accurate measure of the mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2 has not been calculated and the evaluation of its genetic evolution over time could have important implications for strategic planning in the prevention, as well as in the development of vaccines and antibodies-based therapies.

Another important key point is the role of humoral immunity that, as for other coronavirus, might not be strong or long-lasting enough to keep patients safe from contracting the disease again.

After infection occurred, incubation has been estimated to vary from 5 to 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days [8]"
585,"Moreover, there are evidences that SARS-CoV-2 appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of patients in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific, whereas the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with a high viral load in the sputum of convalescent patients arouse concern about prolonged shedding of the virus after recovery [10] .

In symptomatic COVID-19 patients, illness may evolve over the course of a week or longer, beginning with mild symptoms that progress (in some cases) to the point of dyspnea and shock [11] "
586,"Moreover, fatality rates seem to be decreasing over time (15.6%, 1-10 January, 2020; 5.7%, 11-20 January, 2020; 1.9%, 21-31 January, 2020; 0.8% after 1 February, 2020) although this finding could be due to the increasing detection of ""mild"" cases in the general population or to a better management of the disease [14] .

Unfortunately, to date, there are no vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, and there is the awareness that several months may be required to undergo extensive testing, and determine vaccine safety and efficacy before a potential wide use"
587,"However, many doubts about the new coronavirus remain, whereas there is the conviction that finding and sharing answers to these questions could represent a major challenge for public health control of a possible global SARS-CoV-2 outbreak"
588,"Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population likely occurred in mid-November 2019 [16] .

Virus phylogenesis SARS-CoV-2 is genetically very close to SARS-CoV, but sufficiently divergent to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus [4] .

Genome differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could be responsible for the different functionality and pathogenesis.

Virus hosts SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical at the wholegenome level to a bat coronavirus [4] .

Cat civets, snakes, and pangolins are indicated as potential intermediate hosts.

Tracking the path of the virus could be crucial for preventing further exposure and outbreaks in the future.

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences have limited variability and the estimated mutation rates in coronavirus, which SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetically links to, are moderate to high compared to the others in the category of ssRNA viruses [7] "
589,"How SARS-CoV-2 evolves over time could have important implications for both strategic planning in public health interventions, prevention of, and development of vaccines and antibodies.

On inanimate surfaces, human coronaviruses can remain infectious for up to 9 days"
590,"A surface disinfection with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 62%-71% ethanol can be regarded as effective against coronaviruses within 1 min [15, 17] .

Virus spreading to human SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person-to-person via respiratory droplets (coughs or sneezes) and possibly also via contaminated hands or surfaces"
591,The detection of SARS-CoV-2 and a high sputum viral load in a convalescent patient arouse concern about prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 after recovery [10] 
592,"There are evidences that SARS-CoV-2 appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of a patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific [10] .

The fact that asymptomatic persons are potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection may warrant a reassessment of transmission dynamics of the current outbreak.

In symptomatic patients, illness may evolve over the course of a week or longer, beginning with mild symptoms that progress (in some cases) to the point of dyspnea and shock [11] "
593,"Face masks do not seem to be as effective in protecting those who are not infected, and wearing a mask could be useful only when taking care of a person with suspected COVID-19 [20] .

There are currently no vaccines against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

Various vaccine strategies against coronavirus, such as using inactivated viruses, live-attenuated viruses, viral vectorbased vaccines, subunit vaccines, and recombinant proteins are under evaluation"
594,"However, several months may be required to undergo extensive testing to determine its safety and efficacy and before it can be widely used [21] .

At present, there is no single specific antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 and the main treatments are supportive care (e.g., supportive therapy and monitoringoxygen therapy and fluid management)"
595,SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated using human airway epithelial cells and it was classified into the subgenus sarbecovirus of beta-CoVs by phylogenetic analyses of the gene sequences
596,"4, 5 Here, we report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 using Vero cells from a patient entering Korea from Wuhan, China.

The patient with the first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Korea is published previously"
597,"After laboratoryconfirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, she developed nasal congestion, cough, and sputum"
598,"Until 5 days after inoculation, cytopathic effects were not distinct, which is compatible with the previous findings that no specific cytopathic effects were observed in the Vero E6 cells until 6 days after inoculation in the report about first isolation of SARS-CoV-2"
599,"Qualified reads were mapped to NC_045512, a SARS-CoV-2 genome reference using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (v0.7.12-r1039), and a bam file was produced"
600,"These mutations may occur by cell culture-adaptation in that our culture isolate was obtained after first blind passage, or by micro-evolution of SARS-CoV-2 before acquisition in Wuhan"
601,"As a result, it was confirmed that our isolate is a beta-CoV belonging to the subgenus sarbecovirus, and that it closely clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Korea and Wuhan.

In summary, we isolated SARS-CoV-2 using Vero cells from the first laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patient in Korea"
602,"Phylogenetic analyses of the whole genome sequences showed that it clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 reported from Wuhan, China.

We thank Eun Kyung Choi (Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital) for her technical assistance in electron microscopy"
603,"Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the same subgroup of beta coronaviruses, the similarity at the genome level is only 70%, meaning that the new virus is genetically different from SARS-CoV [ Figure 1A , http://links.lww.com/CM9/A209].

Rapid discovery of the causative agent and development of diagnostic reagents demonstrated that technology has greatly improved in the 17 years since the SARS outbreak"
604,"The incidence among medical staff in the respiratory care department of a university affiliated hospital in Guangzhou was 61.7%

(29/47), i.e., more than half of the medical staff were infected while treating their patients.

As for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the first patient with unexplained pneumonia was identified on December 12, 2019"
605,"In contrast to that of SARS-CoV, the discovery of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 came relatively late.

On Dec 29, 2019, an obvious human-to-human transmission case was identified"
606,"Five days later, clusters of cases, including 15 healthcare workers, were confirmed to have been infected via patients, confirming that SARS-CoV-2 also has human-to-human transmission capability [ Figure 1E ]"
607,"Based on these results, it was concluded that SARS-CoV-2 also has high human-to-human transmission capability"
608,"The close contacts of these unidentified patients might act as new infection sources and could become superspreaders.

The incidence and development process of the SARS outbreak has valuable implications for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak"
609,"The spring festival travel period in 2020 started from Jan 10 to Feb 18, which coincided with the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases between Jan 10 and 22, 2020 [ Figure 1F , red box]"
610,"The daily counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases were higher than the daily counts of SARS cases during its peak in 2003, implying a possibly higher number of cumulative cases"
611,"Since SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to SARS-CoV, some important characteristics of SARS-CoV could be used for this prediction"
612,"By combining the reported daily counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases and data from the SARS outbreak, we constructed a logistic model and predicted the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over time"
613,"With this data and the present situation, we predict that the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases might be 60,000-70,000"
614,"Logistic models were fitted to these data, and the cumulative and daily counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases were predicted"
615,"Setting the upper limit of cumulative incidence (K) to 50,000, 60,000, or 70,000, the end date of incidences will be in 56 days (Mar 6, 2020), 60 days (Mar 10, 2020), or 62 days (Mar 12, 2020), respectively.

Using valuable epidemiological data from the SARS outbreak, we systematically evaluated and compared the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV outbreaks.

The two outbreaks share many similarities, and the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak situation seems to be a repetition of the SARS-CoV outbreak situation"
616,"However, due to the lack of awareness regarding the human-to-human transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages, there is a possibility that superspreaders exist"
617,I would like to suggest that the virus be named human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19) instead of SARS-CoV-2
618,"He is also the Director of the Christophe Merieux Laboratory.

An ICTV (The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) work group suggested to name the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was temporarily referred to by WHO as ""2019 novel coronavirus"" (2019-nCoV) "
619,"To avoid conceptual confusion and considerable public fear associated with SARS, the new coronavirus should not be named SARS-CoV-2.

On the basis of the historical nomenclature procedure, I suggest to establish a standardized nomenclature process for coronaviruses"
620,"Based on genotyping, SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be significantly linked to SARS-CoV"
621,"Rather, SARS-CoV-2 may lead to the misunderstanding of the pathogenesis of the new coronavirus, which is less pathogenic compared with SARS-CoV.

Human coronavirus (HCoV) is commonly referred to coronaviruses of low pathogenicity, with human beings being their primary natural host, as exemplified by HCoV-OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1"
622,"2 There are reports that remdesevir and antimalarial agent, chloroquine effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro"
623,"The ongoing epidemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily affecting mainland China and can be traced back to a cluster of severe pneumonia cases identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 World Health Organization, 2020) "
624,"The

International Virus Classification Commission (ICTV) classified 2019-nCoV as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on February 11, 2020"
625,"There is currently no specific medicine or treatment for diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 9 .

CoVs are enveloped viruses with a positive RNA genome, belonging to the Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales, which are divided into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ)"
626,"The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β genus.

CoVs contain at least four structural proteins: Spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein 10 "
627,"The third strategy is directly based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of different coronaviruses to develop new targeted drugs from scratch.

Theoretically, the drugs found through these therapies would exhibit better anti-coronavirus effects, but the research procedure of new drug might cost several years, or even more than 10 years 11 .

For the development of medicines treating SARS-CoV-2, the fastest way is to find potential molecules from the marketed drugs"
628,"Herein, bioinformatics analysis on the proteins encoded by the novel coronavirus genes was systematically conducted, and the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were compared with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV"
629,"

We obtained the SARS-CoV-2 genome from Gene Bank"
630,"We found three coronaviruses from bat (96%, 88% and 88% for Bat-Cov RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZXC12 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, respectively) have the highest genome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig"
631,"Until now, only one crystal structure of 3CLpro has been deposited in PDB (pdb code: 6LU7).

In order to acquire more three-dimensional structure information of proteins about these new coronaviruses for subsequent drug screening, we aligned all protein sequences from SARS-CoV-2 with all sequences in PDB1018 database in Fold & Function Assignment System (Supporting Information Figs"
632,"All other coordinates of target-screening hit complexes can be provided upon request.

In order to verify the accuracy of homologous modeling, we aligned the computational structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro that modeled from the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with its crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (6LU7) just solved and released during this manuscript was being prepared"
633,sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is 76% (Fig
634,"Recent researches speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could also bind to ACE2, and this was verified by computational docking and ELISA measurement 24, 25 "
635,"Moreover, homology of the Spike-RBD sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV

RaTG13 is as high as 95%"
636,"Despite the high homology of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 in Spike sequence, our analysis found that four among the five most important amino acids (L465, L495, Y502, D510, and H514) that bind to ACE2 12 in Bat-CoV RaTG13 differ from SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig"
637,"Among them, for the conformations which most resemble the crystal structure of SARS RBD-ACE2 complex 26 , the binding free energy between SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and human ACE2 was -33.72 kcal/mol (Supporting Information Fig"
638,"The above results suggest that these small-molecule compounds might be the potential 3CLpro

inhibitors and could probably be used for treating SARS-CoV-2.

It's worth mentioning, anti-asthmatic drug montelukast also showed low binding energy to 3CLpro"
639,"The latest research shows that the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with SARS-CoV, exhibiting that the Spike RBD sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV RBD and there are important interactions between several key amino acid residues of RBD receptor-binding motif and ACE2 24 .

Based on the current research progress, ACE2 is considered as a host target for the treatment of coronavirus infection to block SARS-CoV-2 from entering host cells.

Based on the virtual screening results of ACE2 protein, anti-diabetes drug troglitazone, anti-hypertensive drug losartan, analgesia drug ergotamine, anti-bacterial drug cefmenoxime, and hepatoprotective drug silybin, etc., were predicted to bind with ACE2 with low energy"
640,"to be potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors.

In order to further verify the screening results of ZINC drug database and utilize the current resource of anti-viral drugs immediately, we constructed a database of 78 anti-viral drugs for deep calculation, including compounds already on the market and currently undergoing clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.

The RdRp inhibitor GPC-N114 49 .The binding pocket of remdesivir was in the bottom of the RNA template channel, which position was for the acceptor template nucleotide ( Fig"
641,"Fewer compounds were predicted to act on some targets, such as Nsp1, Nsp3e, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp16, NRBD, CRBD, ORF7a, and TMPRSS2,

showing that these selected anti-viral drugs are unlikely to acting on the above targets of the new coronavirus, which provides a meaningful reference for our future research.

For other targets, such as Nsp3b, Nsp3c, Nsp7_Nsp8 complex, Nsp14, Nsp15, PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRp,

helicase, E-channel, Spike and ACE2, more anti-viral drugs were predicted to bind with them, especially E-channel, RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro, indicating that these targets are more likely to be useful for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic drugs from known anti-virals, and should be the focus of our subsequent research.

The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic makes us painfully realize that our current For those targets which are difficult to find direct inhibitors, or non-druggable targets, just like Nsp1, Nsp3b, Nsp3c, and E-channel, etc., currently popular PROTAC technology may be a good strategy to degrade these proteins and then inhibit the virus"
642,"Our docking results show that remdesivir-TP binds to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with a score of -112.8, and the docking results are consistent with its original anti-viral mechanism, so we think remdesivir may be good in treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia"
643,"In addition, remdesivir also predicted to bind with the human TMPRSS2, a protein facilitating the virus infection, this is a new discovery and provides ideas for subsequent research.

Chloroquine phosphate has shown better anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in recent studies, but this drug has no clear target of action"
644,"The WHO have announced that the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 is referred to as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) [15] .

Despite recent efforts in basic and translational influenza and coronavirus research, there is still no vaccine against coronaviruses for use in humans (this includes SARS and MERS) [16] [17] [18] [19] "
645,"Genetic evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is genetically related to two bat coronaviruses [7, 28] "
646,"Contrary to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 cases have been reported to a quite large extent outside the epicentre of the infection"
647,"The numbers of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 continued to grow since its emergence till January 31 (figure 1), and as of the date of this publication, the virus has caused more than 74,000 confirmed and reported infections in humans globally [11, 29] "
648,"Through rapid and frequent international air travel, infections due to SARS-CoV-2 have spread to over 26 countries around the world causing more than 2,000 deaths including four deaths outside China in the Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and France have been reported as of 19 February, 2020 [9, 29] .

The epidemiological data available at the time of this publication are summarized in figure 2 [10] "
649,Infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are yet unreported at the time of this publication in South American countries
650,"Globally, the clinical picture in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have ranged from mild (no or few signs and symptoms), to severe, including death"
651,It will also help determine whether SARS-CoV-2 circulated in Wuhan before December 2019 and will help track the origin of this outbreak among Chinese populations and humans in other parts of the world who had travel history to the epicentre prior to the known start of the outbreak
652,"It was previously reported that the sensitive and specific serological detection of MERS-CoV in subclinical infection is challenging [34, 35] .

SARS-CoV-2 can cause asymptomatic to fatal respiratory diseases [36] "
653,Evaluation of the serologic response of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients according to the disease severity will help determine the potential role of serodiagnostic parameters as prognostic markers
654,"The development of accurate and robust serological assay will help determine the accurate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.

Infections due to SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed [37] , however further investigations are required to determine and understand the full extent of this mode of transmission"
655,"So far, there is no evidence of airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, however precautionary measures are recommended due to the lack of information excluding this mode of transmission"
656,"SARS-CoV-2

transmission in humans appears efficient and the virus is of pandemic potential"
657,"Subsequently, the US declared it a public health emergency on January 31, 2020 [39] , and several travel restrictions to the epicentre of the outbreak were imposed by the USA, Canada, UK, many countries in Europe, the Philippines, several other countries have followed similar travel restriction [40, 41] to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection importation by air travel.

COVID-19 is a recent example of the complex threats of emerging infectious diseases"
658,"The implementation and development of One Health collaborations on a global scale are critical to reduce the threats of emerging viruses [42, 43] .

Regarding SARS-CoV-2 in particular, there are several aspects that needs a One Health approach in order to understand the outbreak, and to mitigate further outbreaks of a similar virus"
659,"SARS-CoV-2 is likely a bat-origin coronavirus that was transmitted to humans through a spill over from bats or through an undetermined yet intermediate animal host (avian, swine, phocine, bovine, canine, other species) or wild animals"
660,"Figure 3 depicts a transmission hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, yet the intermediate host is to be determined"
661,There are no data available in scientific literature on the detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from environmental samples
662,"However, it was recently reported that the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isolated SARS-CoV-2 from 33 samples out of 585 environmental samples collected from Huanan Seafood Market [47] "
663,"Also, this means that the most viable solution may not be to close down live animal markets but perhaps to 'sector' them so that fewer different species mingle in one specific market and that the specific intermediate host(s) for SARS-CoV-2 may be removed from the markets, or rigorously tested for the virus.

iii) Decreasing the human-to-human transmission"
664,"This review does not aspire to cover the large subject of human-to-human transmission control, but also here a mixture of measures is important from strictly medical (transmission routes, efficiency of PPE, vaccines, antivirals and so on) to more social science-oriented (How do people behave when they suspect they could be infected? How do they behave when they are sick? How to potentially change these behaviours?).

To successfully decrease the risk for a new SARS-CoV-2 outbreak or an outbreak of a similar virus, a One Health approach is crucial.

In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19 is continuing to cause global fears, psychological distress, economic losses and negative impacts on several human activities including industry and mobility"
665,"To date, SARS-CoV-2 does not represent a pandemic threat with the same severity as e.g"
666,The first confirmed pediatric case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in Shenzhen on January 20
667,The data from Hubei province was incomplete because children were rarely screened for SARS-CoV-2 initially
668,"1B , during the emerging stage of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the infection was disseminated by person-to-person transmission in the community almost exclusively among adults"
669,"A chest CT showed a ground glass opacity at lingulate lobe of left lung, and his throat swab was also positive for SARS-CoV-2"
670,Nasal and throat swabs taken on January 19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2
671,Follow-up testing for SARS-CoV-2 on January 24 (day 5) and January 28 (day 9) were still positive but turned negative on January 31 (day 12) and February 1 (day 13)
672,"The child's mother, who did not go to Wuhan but came to hospital to take of him was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasal and throat swabs"
673,He was then tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by a throat swab test
674,"Another 30-h-old neonate, born to an infected mother, initially presented with respiratory distress without fever, and later was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, according to a news report by China News Service.

If the disease went further extension without being efficiently contained, the outbreak might go into an explosion stage, when the school transmission mixed with a wider community spread could occur (Fig"
675,Children at that stage can further become the main spreader of SARS-CoV-2 because their infection is usually mild
676,"T lymphocyte subsets showed a decrease in both CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cell subsets, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an early and reliable indicator for the development of severe COVID-19, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can consume lymphocytes, which may also be an important reason for the virus to proliferate and spread in the early stage of the disease"
677,"13 In children, however, white blood cell count and absolute lymphocyte count were mostly normal, and no lymphocyte depletion occurred, suggesting less immune dysfunction after the SARS-CoV-2 infection"
678,"Further studies to unveil why sick children have a milder form of disease may help to the future development of immunotherapy and vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2.

"
679,SARS-CoV-2 has been sequenced [3] 
680,"A phylogenetic analysis [3, 4] found a bat origin for the SARS-CoV-2"
681,"There is a diversity of possible intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, including pangolins, but not mice and rats [5] .

There are many similarities of SARS-CoV-2 with the original SARS-CoV"
682,[6] found that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have almost identical 3-D structures in the receptor-binding domain that maintains van der Waals forces
683,"SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins share 76.5% identity in amino acid sequences [6] and, importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins have a high degree of homology [6, 7] .

Wan et al"
684,"[4] reported that residue 394 (glutamine) in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), corresponding to residue 479 in SARS-CoV, can be recognized by the critical lysine 31 on the human ACE2 receptor [8] "
685,Further analysis even suggested that SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human ACE2 more efficiently than SARS-CoV increasing the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to transmit from person to person [4] 
686,"Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted to also have a strong binding affinity to human ACE2.

This similarity with SARS-CoV is critical because ACE2 is a functional SARS-CoV receptor in vitro [9] and in vivo [10] "
687,"[13] demonstrated that overexpressing ACE2 from different species in HeLa cells with human ACE2, pig ACE2, civet ACE2 (but not mouse ACE2) allowed SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, thereby directly showing that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor"
688,They further demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 does not use other coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [13] 
689,"In summary, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly binds with the host cell surface ACE2 receptor facilitating virus entry and replication.

A key question is why the lung appears to be the most vulnerable target organ"
690,"We therefore predict that the intestine might also be a major entry site for SARS-CoV-2 and that the infection might have been initiated by eating food from the Wuhan market, the putative site of the outbreak"
691,Whether SARS-CoV-2 can indeed infect the human gut epithelium has important implications for fecal-oral transmission and containment of viral spread
692,"1) .

Development of a spike1 subunit protein-based vaccine may rely on the fact that ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor"
693,"[25] recently demonstrated that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry and viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor [26, 27] "
694,"The serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, approved in Japan to treat unrelated diseases, has been shown to block TMPRSS2 activity [28, 29] and is thus an interesting candidate.

The interaction sites between ACE2 and SARS-CoV have been identified at the atomic level and from studies to date should also hold true for interactions between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2"
695,"This suggests that excessive ACE2 may competitively bind with SARS-CoV-2 not only to neutralize the virus but also rescue cellular ACE2 activity which negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to protect the lung from injury [12, 30] "

Potential approaches to address ACE2-mediated COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection"
697,The finding that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the ACE2 receptor for cell entry has important implications for understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and pathogenesis
698,"SARS-CoV and likely SARS-CoV-2 lead to downregulation of the ACE2 receptor, but not ACE, through binding of the spike protein with ACE2"
699,Potential therapeutic approaches include a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-based vaccine; a transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor to block the priming of the spike protein; blocking the surface ACE2 receptor by using anti-ACE2 antibody or peptides; and a soluble form of ACE2 which should slow viral entry into cells through competitively binding with SARS-CoV-2 and hence decrease viral spread as well as protecting the lung from injury through its unique enzymatic function
700,"SARS, similar to SARS-CoV-2, originated in the Republic of China with evidence that while it most likely originated in bats, entered the human population through intermediate hosts, most likely the 'Himalayan palm civet' (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) [8] "
701,"On January 7th 2002, Chinese authorities announced the detection of a novel human betacoronavirus, provisionally named 2019-nCoV by the WHO (and later renamed, SARS-CoV-2) as the agent responsible for the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan"
